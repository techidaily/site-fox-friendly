A special composition technique where the attention of your photos is drawn to the lines leading to the image’s prime subject is referred to as the **leading lines**. It is one of the best ways to improve the composition of your photography for better iPhone photos.

 It paves a simple path for your eyes to trail through the varied features of the photos in your iPhone. Usually, the leading lines in photography resume below the frame, guiding the eyes inwards and upwards. So, the line composition trail starts from the image foreground to its background, leading to the key subject. The leading lines when placed well and paired aptly with its subject according to the third’s rule, can produce truly vibrant and expert quality photographs in iPhone.

## Types of Leading Lines

 The leading lines can be of 4 different kinds- vertical, straight, diagonal, and curved. The idea of the leading lines iPhone photo is to search a line that enters on the verge of the photo, leading the eyes to another point in the photo.
