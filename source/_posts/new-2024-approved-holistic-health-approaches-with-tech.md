## Virtual medical training and education

 Virtual medical training and education is one of the biggest advantages that professionals have got through the infusion of virtual reality in healthcare industry. Surgery training through virtual reality gives immense amount of exposure to doctors, without wanting a volunteer to participate. Professionals learn new procedures, technicalities, usage of equipment, and even interaction with patients through human simulation software are commenced. Simulations are used to teach how to use new medical devices in a virtual and risk free environment. Virtual simulation gives great opportunity to learn with technologies like force feedback, immersive touch and medical realities. It is an engaging and interactive method for surgeons, dentists, nurses, physicians to practice and understand in a practical, visual and safe environment, which is far more expressive and immersive than videos and theoretical training.

 Usage of Robotic devices like arms however controlled by human surgeons enables them to be more accurate and reduces the amount of risk in surgeries which need more accuracy and precision, making it not only accurate but also a faster process. With accuracy and smaller incisions using robotic devices, it reduces the loss of blood and hence helps in minimising recovery time. The precise and small movement is often difficult for human surgeons, while it can be achieved with by robotic devices, and virtual reality in healthcare enables to control those movements. Training and education is required to learn the right kind of pressure required to perform such procedures. Robotic surgical procedure allows surgeons to ensure risk margins to prevent reoccurrence of the disease .Virtual fixtures for a robotic surgery has been introduces to make it more risk free. The skills required for the robotic surgery are required to perform an open or laparoscopic surgery. Proficiency is acquired by various educational and practical sessions to take those intricate decisions.
