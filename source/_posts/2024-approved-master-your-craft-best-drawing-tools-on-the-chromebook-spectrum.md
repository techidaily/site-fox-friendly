Expressing your creativity in the digital medium has never been easier since there are so many apps that enable us to edit photos, create videos, or make beautiful digital paintings. Even though a Chromebook may not seem like an obvious choice when it comes to digital drawing, there are so many different apps that are compatible with Chromebooks that grant you access to the tools you need to make a quick sketch or create a stunningly detailed drawing.

We selected some of the best drawing apps for Chromebook with the aim to help you narrow down your choices and find an app that allows you to unleash the full potential of your creativity.

## 10 Best Drawing Apps for Chromebook

Chromebooks support a broad range of drawing apps that are designed for seasoned professionals or just ordinary people who like to pass their time drawing. Each of the apps we featured in this article can be used to create sketches, drawings, or digital paintings, although the scope of their tools varies. Let’s take a look at what the ten **best drawing apps for Chromebook** have to offer.

### 1. Limnu

**Price:** Free trial, pricing options start at $5.00 per month

**Compatibility:** web-based

All you need is an Internet connection to start creating a new sketch with this web-based collaborative tool. Limnu doesn’t limit the number of whiteboards you can use on a daily or monthly level, while each whiteboard is infinite which ensures that you have enough space for even the most demanding ideas.

The impressive collection of pens and brushes enables you to draw without any restrictions, and all of your creations can be easily shared with members of your Slack team or anyone else. In addition, Limnu is a powerful collaboration tool that allows several people to work on the same whiteboard simultaneously. However, the number of available features depends on the subscription plan you have, since the free version of this online drawing app is only available for a limited time.

### 2. Sumo Paint

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** web-based

With the selection of 300 brushes, a rich selection of layer effects and a powerful text editor Sumo Paint is easily one of the best drawing apps for Chromebooks you can find online.

What’s more Sumo Paint is also equipped with animated and 3D brushes that extend the scope of your drawing and painting options.

Each brush can be easily customized in accordance with the needs of your project, as you can pick the brush style, adjust the rotation and spacing values, or change the gravity level. The Gradient Fill and Color Picker tools speed up the painting process and make it easier to switch between different colors. All images you create with Sumo Paint can either be saved on the cloud on your computer, although you can only choose between three different file formats.

You can choose from more than a hundred brushes and use the Smudge Tool or Gradient Fill to create your images. Furthermore, the maximum size of the canvas is 6144x6144, which means that each drawing or painting you make can be saved in high resolution.

The maximum number of layers you can add to the canvas is limited to 50, but you should keep in mind that the canvas size can impact the number of layers you can create. The images you produce with ArtFlow can be exported as JPEG, PNG, or PSD files. Purchasing the Pro version of the app is mandatory if you want to gain access to all of its features.

### 6. Gravit Designer

Gravit Designer works both online and offline which enables you to work on new projects regardless of where you currently are. However, you will need at least a basic set of designing skills to start working with this app, since the tools it offers are not aimed at the newcomers to the design world. Moreover, the free version of Gravit Design offers only a limited set of options and you must upgrade to the Pro version of the app if you want to use it regularly.

### 7. Chrome Canvas

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Web-based

If you are looking for a drawing app you can use from the Chrome browser to create quick sketches, Chrome Canvas may be the right choice for you. The app is equipped with just the basic drawing tools as you can only choose between Pencil, Pen, Marker, Chalk, and Eraser options.

You can select the colors from the palette or use the Custom color picker that gives you access to all colors on the spectrum. In addition, the app lets you set the Size and Opacity of all drawing tools so that you can adjust them to the drawing you’re working on. However, you cannot use a stylus pen, create multiple layers, or create a digital painting from photos, which makes Chrome Canvas ill-suited for professional design tasks.

### 8. Boxy-SVG

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** web-based

Despite having a somewhat outdated interface, Boxy-SVG is still a great drawing app that is equipped with all the tools you may need to create a digital drawing.

However, the app’s compatibility with stylus pens makes it a great choice for creative industry professionals who want to draw from their Chromebooks. The vast selection of pens and brushes that includes more than 190 fully customizable brushes, huge canvases, or support for multi-layered designs are only a few among countless reasons why SketchBook is one of the best drawing apps for Chromebook today.

In addition, the app can scan paper drawings using the device’s camera, which enables you to digitize all your creations and continue working on them in SkectchBook. The best part is that the app’s Predictive Stroke technology corrects all lines or shapes your draw freehand so that you don’t have to correct mistakes manually.

### 10. Concepts

**Conclusion**

Using a Chromebook for creative purposes isn’t too difficult, since there are so many different apps that provide you with the tools you can use to create visually stunning digital drawings and paintings.

Inexperienced visual artists who are still learning the ropes of the trade should opt for a less demanding drawing app like Sumo Paint or Infinite Painter because they can be used as powerful learning tools.
