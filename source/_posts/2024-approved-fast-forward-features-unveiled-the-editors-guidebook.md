Step1 You will see a few options after selecting the movie in the timeline, clicking the Speed symbol, and choosing the Speed Ramping option. The options are as follows:

![few options after selecting the movie](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/best-video-speed-controller-extensions-14.jpg)

* **Customize**: Five-speed points, by default, let you set the speed precisely how you like.
* **Hero Moment**: There are eight-speed intervals in the video's playback rate, representing a regular, fast, slow, fast, and standard rhythm: 1.0x, 1.0x, 5.4x, 0.5x, 0.5x, 5.4x, 1.0x, and 1.0x.
* **Montage**: The various (six) speed levels in the video's playback speed—0.9x, 0.9x, 6.9x, 0.3x, and 1.0x—present a slow, slow, fast, slow, and regular pace.
* **Bullet Time**: There are six different speed levels in the video's playback speed, representing a fast, fast, slow, fast, fast rhythm: 5.2x, 5.2x, 0.5x, 5.2x, and 5.2x.

* **Add speed point**: To add a speed point, move the play head to the location where you wish to adjust the speed, and then click the Plus + symbol on the left.
