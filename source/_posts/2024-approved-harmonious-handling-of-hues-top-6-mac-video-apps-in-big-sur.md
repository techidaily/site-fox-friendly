 Aug 18, 2022• Proven solutions

Released in November 2020, **macOS Big Sur** is the latest OS version for Mac systems. The operating system is equipped with tons of features and has an optimized algorithm for running apps. Sadly, a lot of existing apps are no longer compatible with it and users often find it hard to pick a decent video editor Big Sur app. Don’t worry, in this post, I will make you familiar with the 6 best video editing apps for macOS Big Sur that you can consider trying.

## Top 1\. Wondershare Filmora

Considered one of the best video editing apps, Filmora is 100% compatible with macOS Big Sur. The tool has some of the most advanced editing options and features a user-friendly interface with no learning curve.

## Top 3\. Apple Final Cut Pro

If you are looking for a more sophisticated macOS Big Sur compatible video editor, then you can try Final Cut Pro. It is also developed by Apple, but unlike iMovie, it isn’t free and has a lot of advanced options.

## Top 6\. Blender

Lastly, if you are looking for a free open-source 3D animation and video editor Big Sur app, then Blender should be your first pick. Even though this macOS Big Sur app is available for free, it has several professional editing options that you would love to explore.

* The latest version of Blender is macOS Big Sur compatible and provides 3D transitioning and editing options as well.

Not just that, the application is extremely easy to learn and has hundreds of templates, transitions, filters, etc. that would save your time in editing for sure.
