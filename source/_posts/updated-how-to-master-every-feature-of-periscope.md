 1\. You will find two lists on **first tab:**

 First one is the Teleport option that takes broadcaster to any random place in world and reflects that place as your active broadcast location.

 The second list contains information about all those broadcasts that you have viewed within last 24 hours.

It also allows real time interactions with the broadcasters as well as other users that are connected during a particular live event.

**The lists of features include:**

 1\. You will find a say something field on your application at bottom portion; whenever you want to comment for any event, you can put your text in this field.

 2\. On the right side, you will observe hearts and they keep on floating upward. Whenever you find something very interesting or just want to appreciate the efforts of broadcaster on channel then you can use these hearts as token for your words of appreciation. You need to tap on the screen to send this heart to broadcaster.

## Tips to get more followers or viewers on Periscope

 There is no doubt to say that Periscope is a wonderful tool if you want to make your career as a live streaming and want to grow size of your followers fast. Below are few important tips to gain more followers/viewers on Periscope:

 1\. Once you have gained lots of knowledge and expertise in a particular area then it is good to develop few scopes so that you can easily share your hints and tips related to that topic. The #hash tag feature helps to attract more audience towards your posts.

 2\. The most essential task that you need to focus upon during your upload is to add eye catching titles for your content. Words of your title can make huge difference as few have power to grab more audience whereas others can suffer more ignorance. The rule is to follow relevant content marketing boosted titles phrases.

 3\. Make some efforts to encourage viewers to send more hearts for your broadcasts. More hearts means you will achieve higher rank on periscope. If you share your scope then viewers can go through it for next 24 hours.

 4\. The powerful solution to grow size of your audience is to stay active to collaborate with other Periscope users. This tip can add more value to your business when you start working in collaboration with other experts.

 5\. Never forget to turn on that Twitter sign while posting your content on scope.

 6\. Update your location details time to time.

 7\. Try to build a strong community and always share a valuable content as per interest of your viewers.
