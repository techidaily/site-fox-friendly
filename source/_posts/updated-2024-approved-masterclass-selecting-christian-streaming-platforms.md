## [1. DaCast:](https://www.dacast.com/video-audio-streaming-service/)

This is a fully equipped online streaming service which is set up with do-it-yourself approach. You can sign up easily and begin sharing of live videos in few seconds. You can also create archives of these videos so that viewers can view, skim or pause at their convenience. You can create your own channel at DaCast and theme them with your design before embedding it to your URL. There is no start-up fees but following are the monthly plans which it offers:

* Starter plan @ $19 per month with a bandwidth of 100GB;
* Pro plan @ $165 per month with 2000 GB (billed at $149 per month if purchased annually);
* Premium plan @ $390 per month with 5000GB bandwidth (billed at $350 in annual plan)

DaCast is a fairly good option but is slightly expensive but is not Ad-free and also it doesn’t provide real0-time monitoring.

## [2. Livestream:](https://livestream.com/)

As the name suggests Livestream has brought exclusive live video solutions for every industry- varying from local communities to global brands. It helps in broadcasting worship events and retreats which members and parishioners can watch on any device. It provides end-to-end production solutions with following plans:

* Enterprise plan @ $799/month;
* Custom plan @ $1199/month

LiveStream overcomes the shortcomings of Dacast and is ad-free with real time support round the clock but its price tag and limited features in basic plans don’t turn out the best
