That’s why you must install all codecs your computer needs to play video files before you attempt to actually open these files in Windows Media Player or any other media player you have installed on your computer.

In case Windows Media Player is not functioning properly you can try opening your videos with some other media player for Windows OS that can be installed for free.

### 3\. How to fix a video that won’t open in an MP4 player?

Even though fixing a corrupted video file is a futile task, you can still try to recover it if you have a media player that grants you access to the tools that are necessary for this task. Installing the VLC player can help you fix a corrupt file, although this process is highly technical and there is no guarantee that you are going to succeed.

Furthermore, whether or not you can recover a video file depends on how badly the file was damaged, which is why you should back up your video files in order to avoid losing them.
