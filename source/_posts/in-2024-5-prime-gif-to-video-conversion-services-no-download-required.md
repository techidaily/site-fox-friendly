## Pro Tip: Converting GIF to Video with a Desktop Solution

While the online tools are usable, but, downloading effective software to your desktop or mobile device might be more accessible to you in the long run. For this, you can use a high-quality [**GIF to video desktop converter**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) instead, namely [Filmora 11](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). You can adjust various aspects like the speed, aspect ratio, background sound, and title. Also, you can merge multiple GIF files, trim clips, and export the file into different video formats, including MP4, AVI, etc.

The process for the conversion is the same on both Mac-based and Windows-based Filmora versions.
