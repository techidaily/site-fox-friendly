 Polaroid Cube+ is developed with much simpler design as compared to GoPro. You can control photos as well as videos from a single button on the top - press it one time to capture stills and twice to record videos. One more button is available for Wi-Fi control that also assists in making connection with Cube+ application. You will find a Micro-USB slot and MicroSD card slot behind the door.

 In case of GoPro Hero4 Session, you will not find any LCD screen on this device but you can view scenes on smart phone screen with app connectivity. On the top portion you will find a monochrome LCD panel that assists in easy setting for memory, battery, shooting modes as well as menu. Memory Card slot and USB connector is available besides the door. One LED on front and another on back keeps on indicating recording and wireless activities.

#### 2.Battery and Charging

 The Lithium Ion battery of GoPro Hero Session can serve you up to 2 hours with 1080p recording at 30fps frame rate. If you keep your Bluetooth and Wi-Fi on and capture 8MP photos once/second then this battery will work up to 3 hour 35 minutes. For Cube+, the battery will serve you up to 1.5 hours even if you have Wi-Fi in ON position. You can charge its battery via Micro USB port using a simple USB power pack, computer or AC-USB Adapter.

#### 3.Waterproof

#### 5.Video and Image Quality

 Cube+ device offers 3 major choices for resolution: 720P, 1080P and 1440P. You can follow 60fps and 30fps frame rate with 1080p and 720p resolution whereas slow motion mode can be switched with 720p and 120fps. For taking stills you can easily switch between 3MP, 6Mp and 8MP where automatic exposure effect leads to much impressive results in daylight.
