Businesses now use cloud storage instead of local storage drives. Many **cloud storage** providers only offer accounts to businesses.

Here is a compilation of the 20 **best free cloud storage** services:

### No.1 Userscloud.com

Although the free plan has Unlimited upload and download, there are some conditions which are:

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)
