Although the PC version of Minecraft doesn't come with a built-in zoom in or out feature, you may change the field of view to suit your tastes. A higher field of view setting will allow you to see more in a single frame, but everything will look a little bit smaller. A zoomed-in display is possible by lowering the field of vision and limiting the number of objects you can see.

Step1 To access the in-game menu, launch a game and hit the Esc key on your keyboard.

Step2 In the game menu, choose the Options... button.

Step2 After that, put the Spyglass you just created in your menu bar and take a hold of it. When you use it, your eyesight will enlarge the area you are focusing on. The same effect as altering your FoV in the settings is achieved with this, but it is faster, simpler, and has more zooming. You cannot lower the FoV setting below 30 by altering it in the menu.

![spyglass options panel](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/spyglass-options-panel.jpg)

Step3 However, you will always zoom in to 10% of your current Field of View while using your Spyglass. When using a spyglass, for instance, your zoom level will be 6 if your field of view is set to 60\. As a result, a Spyglass will allow you to see objects considerably further away.

![spyglass settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/spyglass-settings.jpg)
