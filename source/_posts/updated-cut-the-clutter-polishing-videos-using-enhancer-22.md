## Video enhancer 2.2

Video Enhancer is an application that uses the Super Resolution approach to boost video resolution. Super Resolution is a clever video upsizing method that uses information from neighboring frames to upsize the current frame. It gathers data. Therefore the more sequential frames processed, the greater the quality.

If the image in your video doesn't change too quickly, information from multiple frames can be combined to create a larger image, showing details that would otherwise be concealed. However, no regular image resize/resample techniques can achieve this quality because there isn't enough information in one frame.

### How to use Video Enhancer 2.2?

Video Enhancers allow you to:

* Increase the resolution of your video with the Video Super-Resolution approach, which gives incredible quality by leveraging information from prior frames. At the same time, other resize methods only use information from one current frame. In addition, you may now convert SD video to HD!
* Use VirtualDub's hundreds of video filters to perform anything you want with your video, including deinterlacing, denoising, deshaking, color correction, sharpening, and visual effects.

Because all filters and codecs function in independent threads, Video Enhancer is much faster than VirtualDub.

* Open any video that can be played on your system and re-compress it using any video codec (DirectShow, DMO, or Video for Windows) that you have installed.

However, the step-by-step on how to use Video Enhancer 2.2

**Step 1: Import the file**

Download Video Enhancer 2.2 and launch the software.

![video-enhancer-2-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/video-enhancer-2-1.jpg)

Once you have launched the software, import the file by clicking on 'Browse' to enhance video resolution.

**Step 2: Edit the file**

After uploading the video file, click on 'Add a filter,' and a pop-up window shows various editing options.

![video-enhancer-2-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/video-enhancer-2-2.jpg)

You can create chains with any number of VirtualDub and Super Resolution filters to apply to your video in the Advanced user interface mode. You can filter your video before, after, in between, or even instead of scaling.

With over a hundred VirtualDub filters, you can edit your video, including deinterlace, denoise, deshake, color correction, visual effects, etc. Video Enhancer will most likely recognize your filters if you have VirtualDub installed.

**Step 3: Improve Video Resolution:**

Once you are done editing the video, close the pop-up window and click on 'Add Super Resolution Resize' and change the video resolution.

![video-enhancer-2-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/video-enhancer-2-4.jpg)

Video Enhancer will scan your system for 32-bit video and audio compressors and provide them in drop-down lists for you to choose from. If you have codecs from Video Enhancer's favored list, it will advise which codec to use and at what bitrate. The recommended bitrate is determined by the final video resolution and the codec. After that, it displays its recommendations in the text; you must select the codecs and set the bitrate in its settings to finish the process.
