Gravit Designer works both online and offline which enables you to work on new projects regardless of where you currently are. However, you will need at least a basic set of designing skills to start working with this app, since the tools it offers are not aimed at the newcomers to the design world.

### 7. [Chrome Canvas](https://canvas.apps.chrome/)

In addition, the app lets you set the Size and Opacity of all drawing tools so that you can adjust them to the drawing you’re working on.
