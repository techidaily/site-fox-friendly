Light exposure is the other significant element of the picture as a perfect light exposure draws attention and seems pleasant to the eyes. Many times, individuals capture photos in daylight or in a room where the light exposure is minimum. If your subject is not illuminated perfectly, you can effectively control the light exposure through the VSCO Photo Editor.

### 7\. Control the Saturation

Saturation in photography means controlling the sharpness and intensity of the colors. If you have captured a faded color photo, you increase its intensity by enhancing its saturation. As a result, the human eye will automatically give attention to the color details in your picture.
