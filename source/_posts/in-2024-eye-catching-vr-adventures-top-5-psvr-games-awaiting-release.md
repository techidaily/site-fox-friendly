 The player can also pull things close through the bat claw. There are also certain areas where this can be used for the Batwing to be latched and leave that area. They could also disable circuits and activate switches through Batarang.

 There are three acts of Batman Story:

* Playing Dress-up is the first act where you change to your costume then explores a crime scene with your gadget and see some terrible things happening to your loved ones.
* On the act II you will be the greatest detective in the world and start investigating everything.
* On the last part, you will make sense of them all. After all you are Batman.
