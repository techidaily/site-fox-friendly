#### 1.Replace lens Protector

The best thing to know about Hero5 black is that this device is developed with waterproof body so you need not to use any additional waterproof housing with it.

It is essential to lock the screen while capturing your videos otherwise you may face crash of videos due to accidental swipe on screen.
