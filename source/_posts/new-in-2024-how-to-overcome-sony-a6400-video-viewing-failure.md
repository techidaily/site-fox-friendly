Although this reason isn’t as popular as the rest, there are times when the Sony A6400 records videos in a format that’s not supported by your system.

To fix this issue, go to your settings on your Sony A6400 camera and change the recording format. Most Sony camera models allow you to change the format, resolution, codex, and many other settings. Once you change it, try to view the videos on your camera, and if they don’t show up, you can try another solution.
