[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

Step1 First, download Filmora’s latest version from the official website. Download the app from the [**Play Store**](https://app.adjust.com/w06dr6m%5F19za1f6) or [**App Store**](https://app.adjust.com/w06dr6m%5F19za1f6) if you are a mobile user.

Launch the software and click the **“Screen Recorder”** option on the main software or app interface. A pop-up will open up, showing a red round button.

Next, head to YouTube and search for two Game of Thrones Keen songs one by one for recording. Finally, click the red button to start recording and **“F9”** to stop. The recorded songs will show in the Filmora Project folder.
