## Part 2\. Best 5 free websites to download scripts

When I want to see how a more seasoned or, let's be honest, a better writer than me attacks a story, I usually want to read their script. I want to know how they follow the story on the page and for that... I need to see the script.

But since I don't work in a studio, I must find them online and the search can be exhausting. So, what are the best websites for downloading movies and TV scripts?

Let's go through them together.

### 1\. [IMSDB– Internet Movie Screenplay Database](https://imsdb.com/)

This is the first place I go for scripted stuff. They have an extensive catalog and have proven to be a valuable resource for researching film crews, actors, and trivia. IMSDB is equally useful for those looking for screenplays of all kinds and genres, which they have listed in categories.

![go into the story](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/script-writing-website-6.jpg)

I'm a huge fan of Scott Myers. He gives everything to the writer. Go Into the Story is the official blog for The **_Black List,_** the screenwriting community known for its annual list of the top ten unproduced screenplays in Hollywood. There is always a bank of scripts that you can filter.

### 3\. [Simply Scripts](https://www.simplyscripts.com/)

### 5\. [The Screenplay Database](https://imsdb.com/)

From the website, Blacklist is "...a closed network that connects script buyers, agents and screenwriters in one place". You can upload your script for a fee and then have users and readers rate it on a scale of 1-10\. It is a way to enter the digital age.
