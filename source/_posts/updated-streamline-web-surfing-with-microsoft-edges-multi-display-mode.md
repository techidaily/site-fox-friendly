## Streamline Web Surfing with Microsoft Edge's Multi-Display Mode

Picture-in-Picture is an important feature on Windows and Android computers. It allows you to watch videos while they float on the screen of your desktop or smartphone. Microsoft Edge has PIP on Android and all other platforms to enable you to float videos on your screen on mini mode. And you can watch them as you perform other tasks on different apps and programs.

1. Start Microsoft Edge on your computer
2. Visit any site where you want to play your video from
