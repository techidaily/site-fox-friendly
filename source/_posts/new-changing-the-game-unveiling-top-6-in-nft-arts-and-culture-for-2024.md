## Part 1: Can I Make an NFT?

NFT can be defined as a unique digital token. It is designed on the blockchain concept that makes it similar to crypto currency. However, unlike crypto currencies that act as digital currencies for transactions, NFTs are tokens that are linked to artwork in the digital world. They add uniqueness and authenticity to digital artwork or similar products. As it is based on blockchain technology, NFTs help make digital artwork difficult to forge.

In most cases NFTs cost money. However, there are some creator applications, offline as well as online, that can help users create NFTs without having to pay for them initially. The low entry barrier is possible with a new business model. These are many platforms that allow people to create NFTs for their assets for free. These are billed only when their digital assets are actually sold. So there is no cost upfront that users need to pay. Only when their NFTs are being purchased, the cost is deducted from the sale price.

This is a step taken to help reduce the number of transactions on the blockchain technology sites that manufacture NFTS or handle such transactions. This helps ensure the sustainability of **NFT maker** sites as well.

**How does it Happen?**

* Those who opt for traditional mechanisms to generate NFTs mint the same to a blockchain instantly; to make such a transaction take place, users need to pay gas fees and this can be costly.
* Instead, those who wish to opt for the free minting option; resort to platforms that use a lazy minting approach. This means that NFTs are not minted at the time they are created. Instead, buyers pay gas fees when purchases are being made. Till then NFTs are listed on a marketplace like others and their data is stored safely in decentralized storage.
* Users of free NFT creation platforms simply need to authorize the minting process with their wallets. It is free and guarantees that users hold ownership over their creations.
