## Part 3: More about VOB: What’s VOB File?

You can identify VOB files with .vob extension, and they are commonly stored inside the Video\_ts directory under DVD root. The VOB file formats are usually based on MPEG program streams and can follow few additional specifications in case of private streams.

Note that MPEG programs can also have nonstandard VOB data that leads to a private version of the stream. Generally, VOB files follow very strict subsets of MPEG programs, so in simple terms, we can say that all VOB files use to be MPEG streams, but not all MPEG streams need to follow VOB standards.

When media files are added to DVDs, they are often broken into several VOB files having a maximum size of 1GB. This approach makes content compatible with all operating systems because generally most of OS cannot read larger file size from DVDs.

A VOB file also contains few companion files; they can be BUP or IFO files commonly. You can recognize them with extension: .bup and .ifo. Out of them, the .ifo files possess complete information about DVD so that DVD player can process it easily, and the .bup files contain a copy of .ifo files for maintaining backup in case .ifo crashes.
