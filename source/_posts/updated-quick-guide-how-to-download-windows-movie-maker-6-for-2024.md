## Conclusion

With Internet’s evolution, it was difficult to predict the transformative effects these technologies would have on our entertainment, journalism, and companies. Windows Movie Maker 6.0 was the first program used in the production of YouTube videos. But today, Wondershare has the fulcrum of sound and video tools using its flagship product [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). It works well for beginners and intermediate users so you won’t have any hurdles using it to the full extent.
