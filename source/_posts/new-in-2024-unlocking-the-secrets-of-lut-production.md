Likewise, you can use color swatches to perform color adjustments based on different color modes. Such color modes include SXY, YUV, CMYK, and RGBW, among others.

You will notice the color wheel shows the control points with more saturation in the outer area, while less saturation is geared towards the center region. Nonetheless, it is quite easy to limit the colors on your screen, as you can choose to work with only a few at a time.

**C/L Grid:** This tool is for controlling the contrast of a specific color. Make use of it by rotating the axis angle to influence specific hues to work with.

Use this tool to control the saturation or luminance. This should be according to the existing state of your image, such as the current saturation. Likewise, you can use color swatches to perform color adjustments based on different color modes. Such color modes include SXY, YUV, CMYK, and RGBW, among others.

**Masking:** This is another powerful tool capable of pulling an interesting color mixture. You can create masks based on various aspects of the settings, like hue and warmth.
