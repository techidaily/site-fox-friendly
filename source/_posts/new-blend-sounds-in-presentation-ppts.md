## Part 1 How to add music to PowerPoint?

Before you add music to PowerPoint, note specific points.

Your presentation size will increase by the size of the MP3 music file you add after the audio files are embedded directly into PPT.

For instance, the size of your presentation will magnify by 17MB if you add a song of 17MB to the presentation.

So, the solution is that you need to compress your file size accordingly.

## Part 4 Add more songs to a PowerPoint presentation

You can add more songs if your slide show plays longer than one song. Yet, find that you're having difficulty synchronizing the Audio with the PowerPoint slideshow. For this purpose, you can use a third-party audio editing tool, such as Wondershare Filmora, to combine the Audio into one file and enjoy it all together. And, this makes how to insert music in PowerPoint even easier than before. Here, we'd like to show you a tutorial on using Wondershare Filmora to add music to PowerPoint indirectly but more interestingly so that you don't have to work for longer.

##### Step1 Download Filmora and launch it

02 [Can I play music automatically on PowerPoint](#Part 2)

03 [Get music to play throughout a PowerPoint](#Part 3)

04 [Add more songs to a PowerPoint presentation](#Part 4)

## Part 1 How to add music to PowerPoint?

Before you add music to PowerPoint, note specific points.

Your presentation size will increase by the size of the MP3 music file you add after the audio files are embedded directly into PPT.

For instance, the size of your presentation will magnify by 17MB if you add a song of 17MB to the presentation.

So, the solution is that you need to compress your file size accordingly.

![add music to ppt 1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/add-music-to-ppt-1.jpg)

### Steps on how to insert music in PowerPoint presentation

##### Step1 Navigate to your Title slide (or wherever you want your music to start)

##### Step2 Click the Insert tab

##### Step3 Open the Audio drop-down (in the Media group)

##### Step4 Select Audio on My PC

##### Step5 Visit the folder on your computer

##### Step6 Select the Audio file

##### Step7 Hit the Insert tab

Consequently, the audio file gets embedded in your presentation.

After the music embeds in your presentation, anyone who opens the presentation can access and play the music inside PowerPoint.

Your song will play within the Click Sequence of your presentation by default.

After inserting music into your presentation, you can then convert your entire presentation into a video and share it with your colleagues.

## Part 2 Can I play music automatically on PowerPoint

Yes, you can start the audio in the click sequence or immediately.

<di

##### Step1Click the audio icon on the slide in the Normal view while you edit the slides

##### Step2 Choose Automatically or In Click Sequence in the Start list within the Audio Options of Audio Tools Playback tab
