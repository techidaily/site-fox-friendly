 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

When you work so hard on making and [editing a video through your iPhone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) (let’s say a [tutorial video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to make people aware about something of the essence) if the file lacks music, your video will look incomplete.

Editing is not enough to make the video stand out. Along with editing, you may need to **_add song and sound effect to video_**. And this is why; we will suggest you three ways that will help you **_add music to video on iPhone_**. Hence, let’s begin and double up the fun and quality of your video by adding background music to it.

## Part 1: Change and Add Music on Memory Videos on iPhone

The Memories feature in the Photos app will create collections of your photos and videos highlights. The **automatically generated Memory video** is polished with transitions and music tracks, while, you can also customize the Memory video to **change the music, images included, duration and titles as well.**

### How to change and add music to Memory videos on iPhone

First, make sure your iPhone is **running iOS 10 or later.** And the following screenshots and instructions are taken from iOS 13.

Open Photos app and tap For You tab, scroll down to Memories and tap it.

Tap on the Memory that you want to customize and tap the play button on the right lower corner to preview the premade video.

![iPhone Memory video preview](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-memory-video-preview.jpg)

Tap on the **Edit** button to change the video cover title, the cover image, video duration and music.

![Edit iPhone Memory video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-memory-video-on-iphone.jpg)

Tap Music and you’ll see different genres of music such as Blues, Classical, Country, Dance, Electronic, Holiday, Jazz, Latin, Pop and Rock. (You can also find the Memories from Maroon 5 under Pop)

## Part 2: How to add music to a video on iPhone with Clips

The second way to add background music to video on the iPhone will be Apple’s fresh video app i.e. ‘Clips’. A lot of inbuilt soundtracks are stuffed with this app. You can choose from a number of soundtracks be it pop music, action, chill, playful, sentimental and many more. Here is the tutorial on how you can add a song to a video on iPhone via Apple’s Clips app.

 **Bonus:** [Top 10 Best Video Editing Apps for iPhone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

### Add your own music to your video on iPhone with Clips

Step 1 – Open the app and tap on the Music button located at the top right of the first screen.

Step 2 – Got to My Music option and then choose either category from the screen for instance, ‘Artists’, ‘Albums’ or ‘Songs’.

Step 3 – Now, select the most preferred track from the list that you wish to add in the background.

![clips](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/clips.JPG)

Step 4 – Hit on the Play icon in order to preview the music once before finalizing it.

Step 5 – Once you are happy with the output, you can tap on the “Done” option which can be spotted at the top right of the screen.

![clips](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/clips-save.JPG)

### Add Clips built-in soundtracks to Videos on iPhone

Step 1 – Start with giving a tap on the Music button followed by choosing the “Soundtracks” option.

![clips choose](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/clips-choose.JPG)

Step 2 – You will have to wait for a little for the soundtracks getting downloaded if you are a first time user. Now, tap on the preferred soundtrack and preview it.

![clips click soundtrack](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/clips-select.JPG)

Step 3 – Click on the track once again to pick it out for confirmation. Your soundtrack will be selected once you see the checkmark beside it.

Step 4 – Look for the arrow kind of icon at the top left which indicates the back button.

![clips click arrow](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/clip-arrow.JPG)

Step 5 – Now, hit on the Play icon (a triangular button) and check the soundtrack if it goes well with the video.

Step 6 – Lastly, on the top right of the screen, tap on the “Done” option once you get satisfied.

![clips click done](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/clip-done.JPG)

**Tips**: You can't adjust the music on your videos

Although Clips can be considered as a convenient app, it doesn’t allow the users to adjust the sound once they add music to video on iPhone. Taking instance, the users will not get enough freedom if they wish to do any modifications to the initial point of the video file. The audio will automatically adjust by ‘Clips’ matching the video the best way possible. For adjusting the audio, people will require an extra hand of any video editing app for the purpose.

## Part 3: How to add music to a video on iPhone with iMovie

Another way we would like to introduce is [using iMovie to add music to video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) on iPhone. This app will let you add background music to video on iPhone with the steps given below. Thus, go along the steps to get the method learned.

Firstly, open the iMovie app on your device and go to the “Project” section which is located at the top screen.

Next, you need to tap on the “Create Project” which is available as a ‘+’ icon. Afterward, you will notice two panels namely, ‘Movie” and “Trailer”. Choose the former one followed by tapping on the “Create” option.

When this is done, your project interface will be on the screen. Subsequently, go to the “Media” icon located at the top left corner at the timeline. The videos gallery will appear on the screen. Choose one in which you want to add the music and tap on the “Add” icon. The source video will now add to the timeline of iMovie.

Scroll the timeline to the initial point of the video in order to add the music at the point.

Now you can add music by following the same procedure that we did for adding video from the gallery. This will add the music successfully. Please make sure to place the music at background if you want low volume music. The “Background” option will be at the bottom of the screen.

Now, tap the “Play” button to preview the video along with the music. Once satisfied, tap on “Done” placed at the left corner of the screen.

Tip: If your video’s duration is more than the audio duration, iMovie will automatically loop the background music. Therefore, there is an option to adjust the length of the media file. You can set it according to your preference. Check the guide about [How to edit videos with iMovie](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) for more details.

## Part 4: How to add music to iPhone video with Filmora

Step 3 – Edit Soundtrack

Prior to the finalization of the video, you can also edit the soundtrack for example; you can speed up the sound or [add fade in/out effect.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) You can also start equalizer etc.
