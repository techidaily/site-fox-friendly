_“Love everything novel, attractive, and stirring._

_Travelling, adventures, extreme sports are also a vital part of me, but I like flattering and watching them rather than doing it?”_

**Tip**: The above Tinder profile created by Alex sounds excellent. Although the bio isn't funny, it is creative and unique. The biography has a normal word count, but the words lift a feeling of trust-worthy and a person who knows a way to live and enjoy his life. As the first attraction is about the profile pic, a simple picture with an outstanding attitude for sure will attract a cool person who matches him up or a swipe right.

## Part 3\. Make Him or Her Swipe Right: Create Attractive Profiles

Tinder bio is a small blank space that takes a minute to fill but content matters. While guys most probably swipe over the top to bottom without noting down the Tinder profile description, girls are selective in choosing the perfect match before swipe right.

So, here are some tips for creating a better attractive Tinder profile.

### 1\. Use Tinder Loop

Tinder introduced a Tinder loop, a video feature that increases the chances of getting swiped right. With this attribute, you can capture favorite activities like cliff jumping, and shooting hoops, showcase them to your **Tinder profile**.

As you can import videos from the iOS camera roll, you can create or customize videos using [video editing](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) software like [Filmora from Wondershare](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and add cool effects, transitions, overlays, reversed videos, etc.

### 4\. Synchronize with other social media network

If the 500-word limit in **Tinder profile** isn’t enough to express, sync it to other social media platforms, like Instagram. It will lead to popularity among others, and instant uploading in Tinder will reflect on Instagram.
