## Part 1\. How to Start a Zoom Meeting on Android

There is no doubt that the Zoom app on an android device is easy to navigate through and put to use. All the features are pretty visible and can be used with ease. Also, the phone camera is much better in quality and hence, you can make calls with better visibility of yourself to whom you have called. You just have to opt for downloading the Zoom app by using the Google Play Store. Then you can opt for the creation of an account and you can put Zoom to use right away. Here's how you get started with a meeting using Zoom on an Android phone:

* On the left side, in the upper corner, opt for clicking on the option "**New Meeting.**"

![new zoom meeting android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/schedule-zoom-meeting-android-1.jpg)

* Now, opt for the selection of "**Start a Meeting.**" Once done, you will notice a video conference space.

![start a zoom meeting android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/schedule-zoom-meeting-android-2.jpg)

* At this point, you will see a pop-up with the "**Got it**" button on it. Click on it so you can provide a permit to Zoom to access the microphone and camera of the device you are using.

![zoom access permission android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/schedule-zoom-meeting-android-3.jpg)

* Now, you will see a window pop-up asking you to provide access to Zoom to record a video or click a picture. Click on the button "**Allow**"
* Now, at this point, the screen of your device will have the option "**Participants,**". This option you can opt to use for the addition of one or more people to your meeting.

![allow more participants](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/schedule-zoom-meeting-android-4.jpg)

* Now, opt for clicking on "**Invite**". Here, after this, you will see a menu. This menu will have a few options you can choose from so you can send guest invites. Also, using Zoom's contacts option, you may invite people by sending an email or sharing the invite link, and so on. So it's pretty simple to use in that sense.
* Now, you have to press "**Send Email**" by putting everyone's email address and now, click on the "**Send**" button.
