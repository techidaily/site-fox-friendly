The so-called Bokeh effect adds depth to the photo and it also allows the photographer to separate the model in the foreground from the background. Furthermore, creating a portrait photo with Apple’s smartphones has never been easier, because the latest models of iPhones that have a twin-lens system make this process fun and easy.</p><p>In this article, we are going to show you how to take photos in Portrait Mode, on iPhone X, 8 Plus, and 7 Plus, but we are also going to take a look at a few apps for older versions of iPhone that also enable you to create amazing portraits.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Tips-for-iPhone-portrait-photos"><a href="#Tips-for-iPhone-portrait-photos" class="headerlink" title="Tips for iPhone portrait photos"></a>Tips for iPhone portrait photos</h2><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: For iPhone 7 Plus&#x2F;8 Plus&#x2F;X users</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 1: For iPhone 8, 7 or older iPhones users</a></li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O7ChChlyX2o?si=7pMKdN1NZig1kYek" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="For-iPhone-7-Plus-8-Plus-X-users"><a href="#For-iPhone-7-Plus-8-Plus-X-users" class="headerlink" title="For iPhone 7 Plus&#x2F;8 Plus&#x2F;X users"></a>For iPhone 7 Plus&#x2F;8 Plus&#x2F;X users</h3><p> <strong>Using the Portrait Mode on an iPhone</strong></p><p>The quality of cameras on iPhones has been improving over the years, and Portrait Mode on Apple’s twin-lens devices is the clear result of that process. All twin-lens iPhones have a Portrait mode that can be accessed through the menu located near the bottom of the camera app screen. Pano, Square or Time-Lapse modes are also available.</p><p>However, the Portrait Mode is only featured on iOS 10.1 or some more recent versions of the iOS, so if you want to use the Portrait Mode you need to upgrade your device’s iOS. After you launched the camera app, swipe left and look for the Portrait Mode. Once you find the feature, make sure it is marked yellow, in order to start using its tools. The app will display several different lighting options including the Natural Light preset that is essential for creating photos with Portrait Lightning.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/portrait-mode-iphone.jpg"                      alt="portrait-mode-iphone"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3koT_-kvbks?si=sQV7FzPiz6GYITrE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Image resource: 9to5mac</p><p>Portrait mode enables you to set the timer, turn off the flash or apply photo filters, but it doesn’t allow its users to create live photos. When using this mode you only have to apply basic photography rules, like don’t point your camera in the direction from which the light is coming from and do your best to get within a reasonable distance from the subject of your photos. If you decide to take photos in this mode indoors, you may get slightly underwhelming results because it still doesn’t perform great in low-light conditions.</p><p><strong>Taking selfies in Portrait Mode with iPhone X</strong></p><p>The iPhone X can also take Portrait selfies thanks to the TrueDepth front camera system. Unlike the rear camera system, the front-facing camera doesn’t have multiple physical camera lenses; instead, it uses sensors from the TrueDepth system to measure a precise depth map.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/portrait-mode-selfie-iphone-x.jpg"                      alt="portrait-mode-selfie-iphone-x"                ></p><p>Image resource: imore</p><p>Launch the Camera app, and swipe to the Portrait option, and then tap on the Camera Swap feature to start using the front camera on your iPhone. Find the Portrait Lightning feature in the camera’s Portrait mode, then select one of the options provided by the Portrait Lightning such as Studio Light or Natural light, and proceed to snap a selfie by tapping on the shutter button.</p><p>If there is not enough light or if you are too far away from the camera, the app will show messages that remind you to add more light to your shot or hold the camera closer to the subject of the photo. It is worth noting that the app will not let you take a photo until you do everything that messages on the screen demand from you. However, the Portrait Mode doesn’t allow you to take several photos at once, but it still produces amazing pictures that can be easily shared on social media.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YZma8PBO0D8?si=9-qQgGVTuChYd27a" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="For-iPhone-8-7-or-older-iPhones-users"><a href="#For-iPhone-8-7-or-older-iPhones-users" class="headerlink" title="For iPhone 8, 7 or older iPhones users"></a>For iPhone 8, 7 or older iPhones users</h3><h4 id="FabFocus"><a href="#FabFocus" class="headerlink" title="FabFocus"></a><a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fabfocus-portraits-with-depth-and-bokeh/id1080434313?mt=8" >FabFocus <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> $3.99</p><p><strong>Compatible with:</strong> iOS 8.0 or later</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ezy-watermark-lite-photo.jpg"                      alt="ezy-watermark-lite-photo"                ></p><p>Older iPhone models may not have a twin-lens system, but with the aid of a camera app such as FabFocus, iPhone photographers can easily take photos with smooth blurry backgrounds.

Create a Video to Save the Highlights of Snowboard Cross"></a>Part 2. Create a Video to Save the Highlights of Snowboard Cross</h2><p>When you check out high-quality snowboard cross highlights videos online, you will find that there are certain elements that are common across all such videos. Starting from video effects and video editing to audio additions, here are all the common features used in snowboard cross highlights.</p><p>Pan and Zoom - You will see that still photos are slowly zooming and finally focusing on the main athlete in a group competition. This effect is called pan and zoom effect and it is currently the trending feature in a highlight video with still footage.</p><p>Transition - Transition effects are the most commonly used effects in a highlight video where still photos are used continuously. The transition effects make shifting from one photo to another smooth and eye-pleasing. The video editor you choose to make your highlight video should have ample number of transition effects.</p><p>Slow Motion - You need to have slow motion effect on your snowboard cross finals. This is because you will have to allow your viewers to check out the video footages comfortably to understand the best moments. There is no doubt that video footages are the main selling point in a highlight video and therefore, you have to give enough time on the clips that you collect from social media platforms.</p><p>Motion Tracking - Motion tracking could be the x-factor in any sports event highlight video. Motion tracking is highlighting a particular athlete such as the winner throughout a video clip so that the viewers could understand who the winner is and how he performed.

Create a Video to Save the Highlights of Snowboard Cross</h2><p>When you check out high-quality snowboard cross highlights videos online, you will find that there are certain elements that are common across all such videos. Starting from video effects and video editing to audio additions, here are all the common features used in snowboard cross highlights.</p><p>Pan and Zoom - You will see that still photos are slowly zooming and finally focusing on the main athlete in a group competition. This effect is called pan and zoom effect and it is currently the trending feature in a highlight video with still footage.</p><p>Transition - Transition effects are the most commonly used effects in a highlight video where still photos are used continuously. The transition effects make shifting from one photo to another smooth and eye-pleasing. The video editor you choose to make your highlight video should have ample number of transition effects.</p><p>Slow Motion - You need to have slow motion effect on your snowboard cross finals. This is because you will have to allow your viewers to check out the video footages comfortably to understand the best moments. There is no doubt that video footages are the main selling point in a highlight video and therefore, you have to give enough time on the clips that you collect from social media platforms.</p><p>Motion Tracking - Motion tracking could be the x-factor in any sports event highlight video. Motion tracking is highlighting a particular athlete such as the winner throughout a video clip so that the viewers could understand who the winner is and how he performed. You can highlight the athlete through motion tracking by attaching arrow, text, clipart and likewise.</p><p>Texts and Voiceover - Most highlight videos show titles and texts over the still photos of the event so that the viewers can understand the highlights and moments easily.

As a matter of fact, iPhone’s Photo app features the crop tool, which means that you can crop all your photos without ever downloading a photo editing app.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/crop-photo-on-iphone.gif"                                     ></p><p> Once you’ve launched the Photos app, select the photo from your camera roll or any other photo album on your iPhone and double tap on it to display it in full screen. Click on the Adjustments icon that is located next to the trash bin at the bottom of your screen, and after the new window opens, tap on the crop icon.</p><p> The crop menu will open and you’ll be offered to choose whether you want to crop your photo manually or if you want to utilize a preset. Presets allow you to automatically convert your pictures into a square or 9:16 aspect ratio, so you can just tap on the option that you find the most helpful at the moment. Once the image is cropped simply click on the Done icon to save the changes you’ve made to your photo.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NC0rdKEQ98o?si=HYgqC8CxF_WTO5if" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Photo-cropping-apps-for-iPhone"><a href="#Photo-cropping-apps-for-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Photo cropping apps for iPhone"></a>Photo cropping apps for iPhone</h2><p> iPhone owners who’d like to have access to superb photo cropping options and a plethora of powerful photo editing tools should try using some of the apps listed below.</p><h4 id="1-Cropic"><a href="#1-Cropic" class="headerlink" title="1.

There are different video shooting modes available. You can choose from super slow-motion, timelapse, and even hyper-lapse. Timelapse is capturing a fixed frame multiple times at regular intervals. Thereafter, the captured frames are compiled in a short video form. The frame rate is set low and the phone camera stays fixed at its position.</p><p>On the other hand, a hyper-lapse is a timelapse where the camera moves. You must have come across videos where timelapse plays for a few seconds. You must have noticed how the timelapse transforms the entire video content immensely. You can accomplish the same with your Samsung time lapse and hyper-lapse feature. We will illustrate how to create timelapse video on Samsung mobile devices.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Make-a-Timelapse-Video-on-Samsung"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Make-a-Timelapse-Video-on-Samsung" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. How to Make a Timelapse Video on Samsung"></a>Part 1. How to Make a Timelapse Video on Samsung</h2><p>Suppose you want to shoot a video of the sunrise or sunset. If you shoot in the regular video mode, the video length will be long. When you play the video, the changes in the movement of the sun will be super slow. That is where timelapse can do wonders. You can shoot a long video by taking photos of the scene at regular intervals.</p><p>When you play the photos in video form, it becomes a very short timelapse video. You can show an hour-long sunrise in a few minutes or seconds. You can create such a timelapse video with your Samsung phone. Here are the steps on how to do time lapse on Samsung mobile device.</p><p>Step1 Open the Camera app on your Samsung device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/open-samsung-camera-app.jpg"                      alt="open samsung camera app"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OdlXe5RELW0?si=Iz1H1QnLQVw-Eu3e" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Step2 When the Camera app opens, go to the bottom of the app screen.

A LUT is easy to use and only requires a few clicks. Whether lifestyle, personal, or business, some projects might take a long time to edit. Some projects have a very tight schedule, and editing can even be done overnight! LUTs come in handy in this situation. Most experts have had clients who demand video as soon as possible but have no idea how long it takes to create a video! It takes a lot longer than they anticipate.</p><p>However, you still want to provide a good project; color grading might take a long time to go through all of the clips and make them appear beautiful, and you may not have the time. Here, LUTs can definitely help.</p><h3 id="2-It-provides-a-polished-finish"><a href="#2-It-provides-a-polished-finish" class="headerlink" title="2. It provides a polished finish"></a>2. It provides a polished finish</h3><p>Lookup tables might save you time when editing, but for many creative filmmakers and editors, LUTs are a way of polishing the final appearance of a film. When color grading is poorly done, it can impair the aesthetic of a movie and distract the audience. The beautiful thing about LUTs is that most of them on the market are created by other videographers, so you know they’ll work on your movies right out of the box; all you have to do is make little tweaks to match the vision you have in your brain. If you’ve never used LUTs before but want to take your short films to an extraordinary level, try cinematic LUTs, which will give you that blockbuster vibe on a budget.</p><h3 id="3-A-command-to-adaptability"><a href="#3-A-command-to-adaptability" class="headerlink" title="3.

LUTs can be utilized to convert Log film back to the Rec709 standard, making the Log color profile more approachable to users who don’t have years of color grading expertise. Professionals generally employ log color space to increase dynamic range and sustain shadows and highlights in contrasting scenes. Conversion LUTs now assist in getting over the arduous task of color grading Log footage.</p><p>Many pros and amateurs use conversion LUTs to make this step considerably easier. Many LUTs, notably creative LUTs, are compatible with a video that has been converted to Rec709 from Log. For use on Rec709 standard color film, creative LUTs typically preserve the cinematic and stylish colors. Rec709 is the most common color profile used by most cameras, making it the easiest to work with.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c-BHGGIC0zE?si=FzUQKZa-bx8OlKuB" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-It-gives-a-hint-of-professionalism"><a href="#4-It-gives-a-hint-of-professionalism" class="headerlink" title="4.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Cinematic-Clarity-Premium-Handheld-Stabilizers-Selection"><a href="#Cinematic-Clarity-Premium-Handheld-Stabilizers-Selection" class="headerlink" title="Cinematic Clarity: Premium Handheld Stabilizers Selection"></a>Cinematic Clarity: Premium Handheld Stabilizers Selection</h2><p>When a YouTube video is shaky it’s hard to focus on what is happening in it. Camera shake is a huge distraction and, if it is a persistent problem in your YouTube videos, it will be hard to get subscribers. Shakiness is an easy problem to correct. With a bit of equipment, or a bit of creativity, it is easy to make sure your YouTube videos are nice and smooth.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oySc0DiqmKc?si=8pynRzuhlq2RUPZ6" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Best-Camera-Stabilizers-for-YouTube"><a href="#Best-Camera-Stabilizers-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Best Camera Stabilizers for YouTube"></a>Best Camera Stabilizers for YouTube</h2><p>This article will talk about different types of equipment you can use to stabilize your camera. For vloggers on a budget, there is even one tip on stabilizing your camera without camera equipment. Here are some of the best stabilizers for YouTube videos:</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LBCobAYzzcc?si=J3eSTQ3AdyxWAjGo" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Tripod"><a href="#1-Tripod" class="headerlink" title="1. Tripod"></a>1. Tripod</h3><p>A tripod is a three-legged stand you can mount your camera to. The height of a tripod can be adjusted so you can set your camera up at the level that works best for you. Because tripods can stand alone you can set your camera up to record yourself without needing a helper.</p><p>Tripods are the best choice for vlogs that revolve around you standing (or sitting) and delivering information, like opinion or beauty vlogs.</p><h3 id="2-Monopod"><a href="#2-Monopod" class="headerlink" title="2. Monopod"></a>2. Monopod</h3><p>A monopod is like a tripod in the sense that you can adjust its height, but unlike a tripod a monopod has only one leg and cannot stand by itself. You will need a helper to stay with your camera if you plan to film yourself using a monopod. A monopod is more portable than a tripod, though, and can be used in a wider variety of places. You can even use a monopod to record aerial shots just by picking it up.</p><h3 id="3-Pistol-Grip"><a href="#3-Pistol-Grip" class="headerlink" title="3. Pistol Grip"></a>3. Pistol Grip</h3><p>A pistol grip is a handle you mount your camera to the top of. You can carry your camera around on top of the pistol grip, or you can mount the grip itself to your tripod or monopod. Once the grip is mounted you can use it to more easily control your camera movements. This is a great way to get even, steady, camera pans.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d-COuhPT5mk?si=wLZU6jkkAdJuAn6h" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-Selfie-Stick"><a href="#4-Selfie-Stick" class="headerlink" title="4. Selfie Stick"></a>4. Selfie Stick</h3><p>A selfie stick is a long pole you mount your smartphone to one end of in order to take selfies from farther away. Selfie sticks also make great stabilizers if you are shooting video on your smartphone. To stabilize your smartphone place the handle of your selfie stick on the ground as if it were a monopod. When you are shooting using a selfie stick you can also hold it up in the air to get interesting high angle shots.</p><p>Some YouTubers even like to shoot selfie-style vlogs where the hold the selfie stick just like they are taking a photo of themselves.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vFQCEZiYA08?si=xjIu5IAy77RlHWii" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="5-OIS-–-Optical-Image-Stabilization"><a href="#5-OIS-–-Optical-Image-Stabilization" class="headerlink" title="5. OIS – Optical Image Stabilization"></a>5. OIS – Optical Image Stabilization</h3><p>‘Optical Image Stabilization’ is fairly new hardware which is built in to a lot of new smartphones, like the iPhone 6S Plus and the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge Plus. OIS reduces camera shake by a lot, although it is still a good idea to stabilize your smartphone while you record. OIS will also help you take sharper still photos without using any software.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6nvb0775GOM?si=peBB_Mo_4zcZFuci" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="6-Tables-Desks-Trees-ect"><a href="#6-Tables-Desks-Trees-ect" class="headerlink" title="6. Tables, Desks, Trees, ect"></a>6. Tables, Desks, Trees, ect</h3><p>If you do not have equipment, or cannot bring it where you want to shoot, then you can still record steady footage. You just have to get creative with where you put your camera. Any stable surface will do. You can set your camera down on a shelf in your house, a picnic bench, or up in a tree.</p><p>If you are able to lean your elbows onto a desk or table while you hold your camera then that will also significantly cut down on camera shake. This works best for footage you are not in, or which you can have a helper film for you. If you are open to shooting a selfie-style vlog then you can use anything you can rest your hand on, like a fence or a railing.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-free-gaming-music-archives-no-restrictions-for-2024/"><u>[New] Free Gaming Music Archives (No Restrictions) for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/n-2024-the-ultimate-guide-to-choosing-stunning-thumbnail-fonts/"><u>[New] In 2024, The Ultimate Guide to Choosing Stunning Thumbnail Fonts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-best-bigger-picture-tvs-ranked-10/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Best Bigger Picture TVs Ranked #10</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-maximizing-listener-impact-on-day-of-launch/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Maximizing Listener Impact on Day of Launch</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-compiling-ultimate-list-of-virtual-controls/"><u>[Updated] Compiling Ultimate List of Virtual Controls</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-bits.techidaily.com/1-comment-eviter-la-suppression-accidentelle-de-dossiers-lors-de-lorganisation-des-fichiers-sur-votre-ordinateur/"><u>1.
