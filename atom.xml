The first thing you should keep in mind while creating an unboxing video is to make it short. People who want to watch long videos can do that on YouTube, but the TikTok audience loves short videos. As you already know, TikTok allows you to create videos of 15 seconds, 60 seconds, 3 minutes, and 10 minutes.</p><p>However, the optimal recommended length for good and engaging TikTok’s 21 to 34 seconds. TikTok comprises hyper-specific algorithms which could detect if the viewer watched your video to the end or just passed it up. Thus, ensure you don’t make long <strong>unboxing TikTok</strong> videos, which will bore the viewers.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136612/26400" target="_top" id="2136612">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136612" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136612/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Tip-2-Use-the-Right-Hashtag-to-Reach-Your-Audience"><a href="#Tip-2-Use-the-Right-Hashtag-to-Reach-Your-Audience" class="headerlink" title="Tip 2: Use the Right Hashtag to Reach Your Audience"></a>Tip 2: Use the Right Hashtag to Reach Your Audience</h3><p>One of the most common and effective ways to increase followers on any platform is to use the hashtag. No matter if you are working on <strong>kawaii unboxing TikTok</strong> or a technical one, always use the right hashtag. It is like you are taking part in the conversation on social media.</p><p>Furthermore, hashtags lead to high user engagement and promote your brand. Therefore, if you have no idea about picking hashtags related to your product, the table mentioned below will help you:</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Hashtag</strong></th><th><strong>Total Views</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>#Unboxing</strong></td><td>2.9B</td></tr><tr><td><strong>#unboxingasmr</strong></td><td>585.8M</td></tr><tr><td><strong>#unboxingtoys</strong></td><td>427.6M</td></tr><tr><td><strong>#unboxingvideo</strong></td><td>362.8M</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="Tip-3-Make-Your-Videos-Compatible-with-Small-Screen"><a href="#Tip-3-Make-Your-Videos-Compatible-with-Small-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Tip 3: Make Your Videos Compatible with Small Screen"></a>Tip 3: Make Your Videos Compatible with Small Screen</h3><p>No one watches TikTok on big screens. Before uploading a video, ensure it is compatible with a small screen. You can also shoot your video in both portrait and landscape mode, but 90% of people prefer to watch in portrait mode. Also, cross-check the <strong>unboxing TikTok</strong> resolution before posting it and make sure it’s 1080 x1920.</p><p>However, if the video’s resolution exceeds 1080p, don’t panic because TikTok will automatically minimize it. Other than this, keep the video at 9:16 for a better watching experience. As for the file size, it can vary with your device. For Android, it’s 72MB, and for Apple, it’s 287.6MB. The file types for unboxing videos TikTok support are MOV and MP4.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/unboxing-tiktok-3.jpg"                      alt="create proper size tiktok videos"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-4-Film-in-Well-Lit-Condition"><a href="#Tip-4-Film-in-Well-Lit-Condition" class="headerlink" title="Tip 4: Film in Well-Lit Condition"></a>Tip 4: Film in Well-Lit Condition</h3><p>It is evident that if your TikTok has no captivating and significant points, no one will watch it. Before shooting a video, ensure the environment is neat, clean, and tidy. Moreover, focus on the lighting of a room and try to use aesthetic lights that can cast delightful impressions on users. Play nice background music that can cast soothing effects on the users.</p><p>Create a theme color for your page to give a personalized look to your TikTok. These are very minute details that are mostly eliminated, but they have a part in the growth of your <strong>unboxing TikTok</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/unboxing-tiktok-4.jpg"                      alt="have a proper recording environment"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-5-Be-Honest-and-Personable"><a href="#Tip-5-Be-Honest-and-Personable" class="headerlink" title="Tip 5: Be Honest and Personable"></a>Tip 5: Be Honest and Personable</h3><p>Now, many content creators boost a product that is actually not that good. Before selecting a product for an <strong>unboxing video TikTok</strong>, confirm whether it is worth it or not.

They are both knowledge friendly and entertaining, and many of you may want to create <strong>unboxing TikTok</strong> pages. It is not a complicated process; however, you need to provide valuable content to get more likes on TikTok. There are many useful tips that you can use for success, and some of them are listed above.</p><p>One of the most effective among them is to use a video editor to make <strong>the unboxing video TikTok</strong> more personalized and interactive. Wondershare Filmora is the best video editor to help you increase followers on TikTok.</p><p>Tip 3: Make Your Videos Compatible with Small Screen</p><p>No one watches TikTok on big screens. Before uploading a video, ensure it is compatible with a small screen. You can also shoot your video in both portrait and landscape mode, but 90% of people prefer to watch in portrait mode. Also, cross-check the <strong>unboxing TikTok</strong> resolution before posting it and make sure it’s 1080 x1920.</p><p>However, if the video’s resolution exceeds 1080p, don’t panic because TikTok will automatically minimize it. Other than this, keep the video at 9:16 for a better watching experience. As for the file size, it can vary with your device. For Android, it’s 72MB, and for Apple, it’s 287.6MB. The file types for unboxing videos TikTok support are MOV and MP4.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/unboxing-tiktok-3.jpg"                      alt="create proper size tiktok videos"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-4-Film-in-Well-Lit-Condition-1"><a href="#Tip-4-Film-in-Well-Lit-Condition-1" class="headerlink" title="Tip 4: Film in Well-Lit Condition"></a>Tip 4: Film in Well-Lit Condition</h3><p>It is evident that if your TikTok has no captivating and significant points, no one will watch it. Before shooting a video, ensure the environment is neat, clean, and tidy. Moreover, focus on the lighting of a room and try to use aesthetic lights that can cast delightful impressions on users. Play nice background music that can cast soothing effects on the users.</p><p>Create a theme color for your page to give a personalized look to your TikTok.

It allows you to edit and make beautiful clips using DSLRs, action cameras, smartphone cameras, and other video recorders.</p><p>Go along with the steps below to begin making your TikTok video with Filmora:</p><p><strong>Step #1: Open Filmora and Select an Aspect Ratio</strong></p><p>When you’re prepared to get started on a new video, double-click Filmora’s desktop shortcut. The software’s opening screen will prompt you to start a new project or open an existing one. You can also select the aspect ratio here to save time when editing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-14.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1886048/19272" target="_top" id="1886048">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1886048" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1886048/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>Step #2: Start a New Project</strong></p><p>Wait for the editor to load after selecting New Project from the program’s welcome screen. To fully use Fillmora’s video editor, tap the Register icon and activate it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-15.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p>To establish the aspect ratio for your final film output, go to the File menu and select Project Settings. You’ll be able to choose between other aspect ratios, such as 16:9 or 4:3, the less popular 9:16 aspect ratio for vertically oriented films, and the 1:1 aspect ratio for square-shaped films. You can also alter the aspect ratio to meet your specific requirements.</p><p>Basically, you should use the 9:16 aspect ratio for TikTok videos.</p><p><strong>Step #3: Load Your Clips</strong></p><p>You can find the Import button in the upper left corner of the film editor; pick Import Media Files from the drop-down menu. Next, navigate to the hard drive folder containing the item you wish to change. After selecting the video, audio, or photo files, you wish to utilize in your project, click the Import option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-16.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p><strong>Step #4: Sort Your Files into Filmora Albums</strong></p><p>The files you upload into Filmora will save in the Media tab, which is accessible from the Load button. When browsing for videos and images to add to the timeline, working with several files in a single project becomes substantially more stressful. Create folders and arrange your files with the My Album feature to reduce clutter and frustration.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-17.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p>Click the Add a New Folder icon at the bottom of the “My Project” area in the window’s upper right corner. To boost your productivity and save time browsing through files, you can categorize the film numerically or in another way.</p><p><strong>Step #5: Arrange the Clips on the Timeline</strong></p><p>Since raw footage frequently contains incorrect parts that you don’t want in your video, simply drag them from the Media tab and place them on the timeline if you wish to remove or edit your videos. You can send countless clips as you wish, but you can only do it one at a time, and reordering them requires dragging the files to the appropriate spot on the timeline.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-18.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p>To inspect the video clips you’ve added to the timeline, press Play or use the Spacebar. You can utilize the playhead to jump to a certain point in the movie. Place the playhead at the start of the video section you want to cut, then do the same thing on the other end.</p><p><strong>Step #6: Apply Some Effects</strong></p><p>You may now split the audio and video files, add music, make transitions between segments, or use one of Filmora’s many graphic effects after removing all the useless pieces from your video clips.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-19.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p>To add opening titles, end credits, or subtitles to your video, click the Text &#x2F;Credit icon. There are different text templates in the software that you can use for various purposes. Drag and drop the theme you wish to use to the right spot on the timeline, then use the software’s preview box to add the needed text.</p><p><strong>Step #7: Export Your TikTok Video</strong></p><p>Click the Export button when you’re sure there’s nothing else you want to do with your project. Pick the format that best suits the project you’re working on from the Format menu, give the video a title, and choose its location on your storage device. You can adjust the video resolution, frame rate, and encoder by selecting the Settings option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-20.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-1.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><ol><li>Enter in the username of the TikTok account you’d want to save.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-2.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><ol><li>Choose the most appropriate choice from the results page.</li><li>To download, hit the Download button.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-3.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><ol><li>That should do it!

A competent video editor will present you with a variety of high-quality editing capabilities that will improve the look and effectiveness of your video.</p><p>In this section, we’ll go over different TikTok video editors so you can make an informed decision:</p><h3 id="How-to-Edit-TikTok-Video-Using-Wondershare-Filmora-1"><a href="#How-to-Edit-TikTok-Video-Using-Wondershare-Filmora-1" class="headerlink" title="How to Edit TikTok Video Using Wondershare Filmora"></a><strong>How to Edit TikTok Video Using</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://filmora.wondershare.net/filmora-video-editor.html?gclid=Cj0KCQjw-JyUBhCuARIsANUqQ_Jk8a-_2oxfhbVB0NEFLk4u7Lj59TOtQlwLb0V2EJFBXF3zrgZwVnAaAp5oEALw_wcB" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><strong>It is available on Windows and Mac.</strong></p><p>Wondershare Filmora is one of the most favored TikTok video editors, offering a wide range of editing features and settings to help users make the best music and funny videos possible. It allows you to edit and make beautiful clips using DSLRs, action cameras, smartphone cameras, and other video recorders.</p><p>Go along with the steps below to begin making your TikTok video with Filmora:</p><p><strong>Step #1: Open Filmora and Select an Aspect Ratio</strong></p><p>When you’re prepared to get started on a new video, double-click Filmora’s desktop shortcut. The software’s opening screen will prompt you to start a new project or open an existing one. You can also select the aspect ratio here to save time when editing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-14.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p><strong>Step #2: Start a New Project</strong></p><p>Wait for the editor to load after selecting New Project from the program’s welcome screen. To fully use Fillmora’s video editor, tap the Register icon and activate it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-15.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p>To establish the aspect ratio for your final film output, go to the File menu and select Project Settings. You’ll be able to choose between other aspect ratios, such as 16:9 or 4:3, the less popular 9:16 aspect ratio for vertically oriented films, and the 1:1 aspect ratio for square-shaped films. You can also alter the aspect ratio to meet your specific requirements.</p><p>Basically, you should use the 9:16 aspect ratio for TikTok videos.</p><p><strong>Step #3: Load Your Clips</strong></p><p>You can find the Import button in the upper left corner of the film editor; pick Import Media Files from the drop-down menu. Next, navigate to the hard drive folder containing the item you wish to change. After selecting the video, audio, or photo files, you wish to utilize in your project, click the Import option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-16.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p><strong>Step #4: Sort Your Files into Filmora Albums</strong></p><p>The files you upload into Filmora will save in the Media tab, which is accessible from the Load button. When browsing for videos and images to add to the timeline, working with several files in a single project becomes substantially more stressful. Create folders and arrange your files with the My Album feature to reduce clutter and frustration.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-17.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p>Click the Add a New Folder icon at the bottom of the “My Project” area in the window’s upper right corner. To boost your productivity and save time browsing through files, you can categorize the film numerically or in another way.</p><p><strong>Step #5: Arrange the Clips on the Timeline</strong></p><p>Since raw footage frequently contains incorrect parts that you don’t want in your video, simply drag them from the Media tab and place them on the timeline if you wish to remove or edit your videos. You can send countless clips as you wish, but you can only do it one at a time, and reordering them requires dragging the files to the appropriate spot on the timeline.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-18.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p>To inspect the video clips you’ve added to the timeline, press Play or use the Spacebar. You can utilize the playhead to jump to a certain point in the movie. Place the playhead at the start of the video section you want to cut, then do the same thing on the other end.</p><p><strong>Step #6: Apply Some Effects</strong></p><p>You may now split the audio and video files, add music, make transitions between segments, or use one of Filmora’s many graphic effects after removing all the useless pieces from your video clips.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-19.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p>To add opening titles, end credits, or subtitles to your video, click the Text &#x2F;Credit icon. There are different text templates in the software that you can use for various purposes. Drag and drop the theme you wish to use to the right spot on the timeline, then use the software’s preview box to add the needed text.</p><p><strong>Step #7: Export Your TikTok Video</strong></p><p>Click the Export button when you’re sure there’s nothing else you want to do with your project. Pick the format that best suits the project you’re working on from the Format menu, give the video a title, and choose its location on your storage device. You can adjust the video resolution, frame rate, and encoder by selecting the Settings option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-20.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-1.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><ol><li>Enter in the username of the TikTok account you’d want to save.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-2.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><ol><li>Choose the most appropriate choice from the results page.</li><li>To download, hit the Download button.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-3.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1770544">                    <video width="240" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1770544.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/20702-1770544">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1770544.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:150px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Ftokenmetrics.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1770544%2F20702'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1770544/20702"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><ol><li>That should do it!

A competent video editor will present you with a variety of high-quality editing capabilities that will improve the look and effectiveness of your video.</p><p>In this section, we’ll go over different TikTok video editors so you can make an informed decision:</p><h3 id="How-to-Edit-TikTok-Video-Using-Wondershare-Filmora-2"><a href="#How-to-Edit-TikTok-Video-Using-Wondershare-Filmora-2" class="headerlink" title="How to Edit TikTok Video Using Wondershare Filmora"></a><strong>How to Edit TikTok Video Using</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://filmora.wondershare.net/filmora-video-editor.html?gclid=Cj0KCQjw-JyUBhCuARIsANUqQ_Jk8a-_2oxfhbVB0NEFLk4u7Lj59TOtQlwLb0V2EJFBXF3zrgZwVnAaAp5oEALw_wcB" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><strong>It is available on Windows and Mac.</strong></p><p>Wondershare Filmora is one of the most favored TikTok video editors, offering a wide range of editing features and settings to help users make the best music and funny videos possible. It allows you to edit and make beautiful clips using DSLRs, action cameras, smartphone cameras, and other video recorders.</p><p>Go along with the steps below to begin making your TikTok video with Filmora:</p><p><strong>Step #1: Open Filmora and Select an Aspect Ratio</strong></p><p>When you’re prepared to get started on a new video, double-click Filmora’s desktop shortcut. The software’s opening screen will prompt you to start a new project or open an existing one. You can also select the aspect ratio here to save time when editing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-14.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p><strong>Step #2: Start a New Project</strong></p><p>Wait for the editor to load after selecting New Project from the program’s welcome screen. To fully use Fillmora’s video editor, tap the Register icon and activate it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-15.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p>To establish the aspect ratio for your final film output, go to the File menu and select Project Settings. You’ll be able to choose between other aspect ratios, such as 16:9 or 4:3, the less popular 9:16 aspect ratio for vertically oriented films, and the 1:1 aspect ratio for square-shaped films. You can also alter the aspect ratio to meet your specific requirements.</p><p>Basically, you should use the 9:16 aspect ratio for TikTok videos.</p><p><strong>Step #3: Load Your Clips</strong></p><p>You can find the Import button in the upper left corner of the film editor; pick Import Media Files from the drop-down menu. Next, navigate to the hard drive folder containing the item you wish to change. After selecting the video, audio, or photo files, you wish to utilize in your project, click the Import option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-16.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p><strong>Step #4: Sort Your Files into Filmora Albums</strong></p><p>The files you upload into Filmora will save in the Media tab, which is accessible from the Load button. When browsing for videos and images to add to the timeline, working with several files in a single project becomes substantially more stressful. Create folders and arrange your files with the My Album feature to reduce clutter and frustration.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-17.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p>Click the Add a New Folder icon at the bottom of the “My Project” area in the window’s upper right corner. To boost your productivity and save time browsing through files, you can categorize the film numerically or in another way.</p><p><strong>Step #5: Arrange the Clips on the Timeline</strong></p><p>Since raw footage frequently contains incorrect parts that you don’t want in your video, simply drag them from the Media tab and place them on the timeline if you wish to remove or edit your videos. You can send countless clips as you wish, but you can only do it one at a time, and reordering them requires dragging the files to the appropriate spot on the timeline.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-18.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p>To inspect the video clips you’ve added to the timeline, press Play or use the Spacebar. You can utilize the playhead to jump to a certain point in the movie. Place the playhead at the start of the video section you want to cut, then do the same thing on the other end.</p><p><strong>Step #6: Apply Some Effects</strong></p><p>You may now split the audio and video files, add music, make transitions between segments, or use one of Filmora’s many graphic effects after removing all the useless pieces from your video clips.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-19.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135409/19272" target="_top" id="2135409">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135409" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="125" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135409/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>To add opening titles, end credits, or subtitles to your video, click the Text &#x2F;Credit icon. There are different text templates in the software that you can use for various purposes. Drag and drop the theme you wish to use to the right spot on the timeline, then use the software’s preview box to add the needed text.</p><p><strong>Step #7: Export Your TikTok Video</strong></p><p>Click the Export button when you’re sure there’s nothing else you want to do with your project. Pick the format that best suits the project you’re working on from the Format menu, give the video a title, and choose its location on your storage device. You can adjust the video resolution, frame rate, and encoder by selecting the Settings option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-20.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2016134/19272" target="_top" id="2016134">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2016134" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2016134/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-1.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><ol><li>Enter in the username of the TikTok account you’d want to save.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-2.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><ol><li>Choose the most appropriate choice from the results page.</li><li>To download, hit the Download button.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-3.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><ol><li>That should do it!

It allows you to edit and make beautiful clips using DSLRs, action cameras, smartphone cameras, and other video recorders.</p><p>Go along with the steps below to begin making your TikTok video with Filmora:</p><p><strong>Step #1: Open Filmora and Select an Aspect Ratio</strong></p><p>When you’re prepared to get started on a new video, double-click Filmora’s desktop shortcut. The software’s opening screen will prompt you to start a new project or open an existing one. You can also select the aspect ratio here to save time when editing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-14.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p><strong>Step #2: Start a New Project</strong></p><p>Wait for the editor to load after selecting New Project from the program’s welcome screen. To fully use Fillmora’s video editor, tap the Register icon and activate it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-15.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p>To establish the aspect ratio for your final film output, go to the File menu and select Project Settings. You’ll be able to choose between other aspect ratios, such as 16:9 or 4:3, the less popular 9:16 aspect ratio for vertically oriented films, and the 1:1 aspect ratio for square-shaped films. You can also alter the aspect ratio to meet your specific requirements.</p><p>Basically, you should use the 9:16 aspect ratio for TikTok videos.</p><p><strong>Step #3: Load Your Clips</strong></p><p>You can find the Import button in the upper left corner of the film editor; pick Import Media Files from the drop-down menu. Next, navigate to the hard drive folder containing the item you wish to change. After selecting the video, audio, or photo files, you wish to utilize in your project, click the Import option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-16.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p><strong>Step #4: Sort Your Files into Filmora Albums</strong></p><p>The files you upload into Filmora will save in the Media tab, which is accessible from the Load button. When browsing for videos and images to add to the timeline, working with several files in a single project becomes substantially more stressful. Create folders and arrange your files with the My Album feature to reduce clutter and frustration.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-17.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p>Click the Add a New Folder icon at the bottom of the “My Project” area in the window’s upper right corner. To boost your productivity and save time browsing through files, you can categorize the film numerically or in another way.</p><p><strong>Step #5: Arrange the Clips on the Timeline</strong></p><p>Since raw footage frequently contains incorrect parts that you don’t want in your video, simply drag them from the Media tab and place them on the timeline if you wish to remove or edit your videos. You can send countless clips as you wish, but you can only do it one at a time, and reordering them requires dragging the files to the appropriate spot on the timeline.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-18.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p>To inspect the video clips you’ve added to the timeline, press Play or use the Spacebar. You can utilize the playhead to jump to a certain point in the movie. Place the playhead at the start of the video section you want to cut, then do the same thing on the other end.</p><p><strong>Step #6: Apply Some Effects</strong></p><p>You may now split the audio and video files, add music, make transitions between segments, or use one of Filmora’s many graphic effects after removing all the useless pieces from your video clips.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-19.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p>To add opening titles, end credits, or subtitles to your video, click the Text &#x2F;Credit icon. There are different text templates in the software that you can use for various purposes. Drag and drop the theme you wish to use to the right spot on the timeline, then use the software’s preview box to add the needed text.</p><p><strong>Step #7: Export Your TikTok Video</strong></p><p>Click the Export button when you’re sure there’s nothing else you want to do with your project. Pick the format that best suits the project you’re working on from the Format menu, give the video a title, and choose its location on your storage device. You can adjust the video resolution, frame rate, and encoder by selecting the Settings option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-20.jpg"                      alt="mass-download-tiktok-"                ></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-ultimate-online-destinations-for-3d-shimmering-letters/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Ultimate Online Destinations for 3D Shimmering Letters</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-digital-dome-streamlining-your-song-posts-on-youtube/"><u>[New] Digital Dome Streamlining Your Song Posts on YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/new-syncing-with-serenity-listening-to-podcasts-on-iphone-for-2024/"><u>[New] Syncing With Serenity Listening to Podcasts on iPhone for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/new-transforming-unboxing-into-art/"><u>[New] Transforming Unboxing Into Art</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-boost-your-bank-account-quickly-with-these-13-ways-to-profit-on-reddit/"><u>[Updated] Boost Your Bank Account Quickly With These 13 Ways to Profit on Reddit</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-premier-programs-designing-animated-3d-worlds/"><u>[Updated] Premier Programs Designing Animated 3D Worlds</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-strategies-to-acquire-top-notch-hdr-cameras/"><u>[Updated] Strategies to Acquire Top-Notch HDR Cameras</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-vdieo-software.techidaily.com/in-2024-best-converter-how-to-convert-and-download-4k-video-in-mp4-format/"><u>In 2024, Best Converter How to Convert and Download 4K Video in MP4 Format</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/innovation-at-speed-how-to-make-stunning-slow-motion-content-with-an-android-for-2024/"><u>Innovation at Speed How to Make Stunning Slow-Motion Content with an Android for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/simplifying-smartphone-productivity-emulate-pc-window-management-for-efficient-task-handling/"><u>Simplifying Smartphone Productivity: Emulate PC Window Management for Efficient Task Handling</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/tomorrows-scrutiny-innovative-perspectives-for-2024/"><u>Tomorrow’s Scrutiny Innovative Perspectives for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/top-15-video-compressors-for-optimizing-pc-media-files/"><u>Top 15 Video Compressors for Optimizing PC Media Files</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Picsart has a range of funny blur effects that you can apply to your image and have a whale of a time. These effects do not mirror reality but give your picture a cinematic look. Follow the steps above, but when you get to the part where you tap Effects and have selected the Blur options, opt for a different blur filter.</p><p>With that in mind, let’s look at some funny blur effects in Picsart that you might want to try.</p><h4 id="Motion-Blur-3"><a href="#Motion-Blur-3" class="headerlink" title="Motion Blur"></a>Motion Blur</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-face-in-picsart-4.png"                      alt="funny blur effects in picsart - motion blur"                ></p><p>As the name suggests, this funny blur effect looks amazing on pictures of vehicles and people in motion. All you have to do is apply the filter, then use the adjustment slider to decrease or increase the intensity of the effect.</p><p>When you choose the Motion Blur, this effect automatically colorizes your picture. You can select the color you want by dragging the hue slider; unclick the box located next to the slider to turn the colorization off completely. Your picture will turn back to the original color.</p><p>What’s more? You can play around with Noise, Angle, and Distance sliders to apply the right amount of motion blur to photos and make sure the sense of movement will go in the right direction.</p><h4 id="Smart-Blur-3"><a href="#Smart-Blur-3" class="headerlink" title="Smart Blur"></a>Smart Blur</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-face-in-picsart-5.png"                      alt="funny blur effects in picsart - smart blur"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2111968/7443" target="_top" id="2111968">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2111968" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2111968/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Smart Blur gives your photos a luxurious sheen; it blurs out details to make subjects appear less real and a bit more unnaturally perfect. You can consider it a magazine finish.</p><h4 id="Radial-Blur-3"><a href="#Radial-Blur-3" class="headerlink" title="Radial Blur"></a>Radial Blur</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-face-in-picsart-6.png"                      alt="funny blur effects in picsart - Radial Blur"                ></p><p>This blur effect allows you to turn photos into a spinning vortex. It allows you to create a circle of blur effect around a focal point in photos. Every circle has a focal point, and you can move the center of the blur by dragging the crosshairs located in the middle of the blur.</p><p>Objects in your image will bend with the curve of the blur; anything lying in the middle of the circling blur will become a greater point of focus. Move the Blur slider located in the effects settings menu to make your image less or more blurry Zero is the minimum, while 20 is the maximum.</p><p>You can try to apply the Radial Blur effect to automobiles, trains, and planes to intensify their velocity effect.</p><h4 id="Focal-Blur-3"><a href="#Focal-Blur-3" class="headerlink" title="Focal Blur"></a>Focal Blur</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-face-in-picsart-7.png"                      alt="funny blur effects in picsart - Focal Blur"                ></p><p>Focal blur is a radial effect that warps the dimensions of your picture a little for an in-motion look. It’s perfect for images that have subjects in high-speed settings.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>● Nowadays, the blur effect is a common thing that it’s difficult to believe that it used to be regarded as a sign of flawed photography. Photo blurring became widely acknowledged as legit in the late Nineties, and even an aspirational technique called bokeh, a Japanese term that loosely translates as blur quality.</p><p>● A quick scan of social media imagery shows how popular it has become over the years. You might have been looking in envy at those dreamy and hazy photos asking yourself: How did the photographer manage this? The answer is Picsart.</p><p>● This application has made blurring faces and backgrounds in photos a breeze. That means you can now easily reproduce the blur effect on your photography. The best part is: It is quick and simple to achieve this. Whether you want to hide distracting elements or highlight a figure in the foreground, Picsart can help.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-harmonizing-hashtags-instagram-tiktok-collaborative-guide/"><u>[New] Harmonizing Hashtags Instagram-TikTok Collaborative Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-comprehensive-guide-to-effective-multiframe-use-in-edge/"><u>[New] In 2024, Comprehensive Guide to Effective Multiframe Use in Edge</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-lowering-the-quality-of-obs-streaming/"><u>[New] In 2024, Lowering the Quality of OBS Streaming</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-navigating-vrs-negative-aspects-for-2024/"><u>[New] Navigating VR's Negative Aspects for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-step-up-your-sj4000-game-with-these-accessories/"><u>[New] Step Up Your SJ4000 Game with These Accessories</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-speed-meets-strategy-key-moments-at-the-games/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Speed Meets Strategy Key Moments at the Games</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-unveiling-time-lapse-techniques-for-samsung-enthusiasts/"><u>[Updated] Unveiling Time Lapse Techniques for Samsung Enthusiasts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/2024-approved-perfect-package-presentation-transformative-openings/"><u>2024 Approved Perfect Package Presentation Transformative Openings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11-tips.techidaily.com/enabling-and-disabling-windows-key-in-windows-os/"><u>Enabling and Disabling Windows Key in Windows OS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/enhancing-video-clarity-on-android-comprehensive-steps/"><u>Enhancing Video Clarity on Android – Comprehensive Steps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/explore-premium-4k-converters-for-flawless-recordings/"><u>Explore Premium 4K Converters for Flawless Recordings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/in-2024-capture-and-share-your-games-like-a-pro-with-these-windows-11-tactics/"><u>In 2024, Capture and Share Your Games Like a Pro with These Windows 11 Tactics</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-everything-you-need-to-know-about-unlocked-iphone-13-pro-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, Everything You Need To Know About Unlocked iPhone 13 Pro</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/in-2024-from-dull-to-dynamic-top-11-techniques-for-enhanced-hues/"><u>In 2024, From Dull to Dynamic Top 11 Techniques for Enhanced Hues</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/in-2024-from-raw-footage-to-final-cut-adopting-luts-in-premiere/"><u>In 2024, From Raw Footage to Final Cut Adopting LUTs in Premiere</u></a></li><li><a href="https://activate-lock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-bypass-icloud-lock-from-apple-iphone-14-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, How to Bypass iCloud Lock from Apple iPhone 14</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-smartphone-lens-creating-sweeping-panos/"><u>In 2024, The Smartphone Lens Creating Sweeping Panos</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="The-Art-of-Using-Videos-in-Education"><a href="#The-Art-of-Using-Videos-in-Education" class="headerlink" title="The Art of Using Videos in Education"></a>The Art of Using Videos in Education</h2><p>The use of videos in online classrooms or classes is a very much researched topic that has greatly benefited many students. Students and teachers all agree on using video as a teaching tool. The availability of free and high-quality videos online also makes the perfect addition to mixed learning environments.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/video-lecture.jpg"                      alt="video lecture"                ></p><p>Due to the pandemic, we can’t go back to school and teach our students face-to-face; the best option we need to do is to show create and personalized video for the class. Of course, as teachers, we also need the creativity to do the videos for our students.</p><p>Video in education can help the Teachers and Students as well.</p><ul><li>Teachers can find, share, and use some videos that someone else has made.</li><li>Teachers can create their videos using a camera, phone, or maybe a screencast.</li><li>Teachers can host a video conference for the class and the school.</li><li>Knowing how the teacher discusses the lesson allows the students to create their videos.</li></ul><p>The two options for sharing videos with your students are synchronous or asynchronous.</p><p><strong>Synchronous Videos -</strong> it could be a live stream or an interactive video conference. It depends on the school if they want to use Zoom or Google Meet for their classes. We can record synchronous videos for the students so they can view them later if they request. It is helpful and valuable for the students if they can’t attend the live stream or, we can say, online class because of technical issues or important events they need to follow.</p><p>Some schools find that synchronous videos are a great way to keep the students connected. But there’s a problem with privacy issues nowadays, especially with the students if they are shown in synchronous videos and recorded. Make sure you need the student’s permission to record the video. We don’t also forget the internet connection issues of some students. Don’t forget and take note of that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/synchronous-videos-lecture.jpg"                      alt="synchronous videos lecture"                ></p><p><strong>Asynchronous Videos -</strong> you need to record videos that can be viewed and reviewed by the students. Your videos could be a recorded activity using a mobile phone or a screencast for them to know the lesson on that day. Screencasting is where you narrate a video recording or explain the task to your students using your computer screen. It’s up to the teacher if they want to use audio, or you can also see your face in the video.</p><p>Asynchronous learning can be more convenient for the students and allows them to learn anytime they want and place wherever they are. It can also be challenging for teachers to know whether students watched the videos or engaged with the work. We don’t know if the students watched the videos or learned something in the videos. So, double-check it, teacher time to time.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/online-video-class.jpg"                      alt="online video class"                ></p><p>Using videos in online classes or classrooms has many benefits and can be adapted for any learning objective. You might find it helpful to use synchronous and asynchronous videos simultaneously. Research continues to provide more insights on how to better utilize video in online classes or classrooms.</p><h2 id="Different-ways-to-use-video-in-Online-Classes"><a href="#Different-ways-to-use-video-in-Online-Classes" class="headerlink" title="Different ways to use video in Online Classes"></a>Different ways to use video in Online Classes</h2><p><strong>Keep your videos short</strong></p><p>More effective if the videos you created are shorter. 12 to 15 minutes is the maximum time for the higher students (high school level) and 8 to 10 minutes for the younger students (elementary level). So, try to keep your videos as short as possible while addressing the central concept of the lesson. If you want to use a longer video, break it into smaller segments. Explain to the students the topics and the sub-topics of the lessons. You can divide it into the number of days you need to discuss that lesson.</p><p><strong>Choose suitable videos</strong></p><p>Some video elements are there to entertain and serve no educational purposes. Just avoid the videos with a noise like bells, whistles, or any background music to distract the students from the point of learning. Double-check everything you put into your video to ensure that it is suitable for the ears of the students.</p><p><strong>Video Watching with the students</strong></p><p>Thanks to YouTube, we have to find some content to add to our lessons and become part of the learning sequences of our classes. Add at least just 5 minutes to make sure your class time is not compromised. This type of learning will help the students before, during, or even after watching the videos, leading to outstanding learning outcomes.</p><p>Some activities will help the students to correct their overconfidence about how much they have learned from watching a video. You can add some pop-up questions throughout a video or give them an old-fashioned way, giving quizzes after watching the video to improve their learning.</p><p><strong>Watch on Individual Screens</strong></p><p>According to my research, most teachers like using a shared screen, and this will be beneficial for starting conversations, group learning exercises, and experience sharing. The students can view and learn something from the video at their homes. The students also have an advantage because they can view the video at their own pace, pause it when they want to go somewhere, or move it forwards and backward to the parts of the footage they need to hear again. This video is a way to help them manage the lesson flow so they can take some notes about it or complete the assignments and activities without missing anything.</p><p>Video has been an effective instructional tool for teachers with a track record of improving students’ learning. Today, we are leading the way toward increased reliance on video in the classroom. Video is being creatively used for learning by both teachers and students. Soon, video usage will likely increase even more. A major contributor to this expansion is the increased accessibility of technology and better internet connectivity.</p><p>More and more research supporting the advantages of blended learning will support video usage. Students will be able to benefit the most from this revolutionary trend as schools set themselves up to promote multimedia learning by carefully evaluating hardware audio along with image quality.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-perfected-podcasts-iphones-seamless-audio-download-routines/"><u>[New] In 2024, Perfected Podcasts IPhone's Seamless Audio Download Routines</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-essential-tips-for-crafting-gifs/"><u>[Updated] Essential Tips for Crafting GIFs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-explore-new-horizons-in-video-editing-software/"><u>[Updated] Explore New Horizons in Video Editing Software</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-pros-secret-insights-into-windows-11/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Pro's Secret Insights Into Windows 11</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/2024-approved-mobile-melodies-crafting-unique-phone-ringtones-for-android-enthusiasts/"><u>2024 Approved Mobile Melodies Crafting Unique Phone Ringtones for Android Enthusiasts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/2024-approved-quick-steps-to-proficient-gif-design/"><u>2024 Approved Quick Steps to Proficient GIF Design</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discover-help.techidaily.com/effective-strategies-secure-your-data-with-command-prompt-backups-in-windows-10/"><u>Effective Strategies: Secure Your Data with Command Prompt Backups in Windows 10</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-renaissance.techidaily.com/expert-tips-for-removing-facebook-on-android-a-comprehensive-guide/"><u>Expert Tips for Removing Facebook on Android - A Comprehensive Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://hardware-help.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-guide-recovering-missing-apple-airpods-effectively/"><u>The Ultimate Guide: Recovering Missing Apple AirPods Effectively</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-renaissance.techidaily.com/unveiling-the-secrets-of-finding-missing-communications-on-gmail/"><u>Unveiling the Secrets of Finding Missing Communications on Gmail</u></a></li></ul></div><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118306/7443" target="_top" id="2118306">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118306" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118306/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->]]></content>

In fact, according to a recent study, 92% of consumers say they heavily rely on online reviews and testimonials when making purchasing decisions. 88% of those consumers say they trust those testimonials as much as personal recommendations from their friends, family members, and colleagues. This means that if you can get your clients or customers talking about how great your products or services are on camera, it will help them make buying decisions, reinforce your brand message and build relationships with their followers and peers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/video-testimonial.jpg"                      alt="video testimonial"                ></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Why-Video-Testimonials-Are-Important-for-Marketing"><a href="#Why-Video-Testimonials-Are-Important-for-Marketing" class="headerlink" title="Why Video Testimonials Are Important for Marketing"></a>Why Video Testimonials Are Important for Marketing</h2><h3 id="Video-testimonials-help-customers-make-their-buying-decisions"><a href="#Video-testimonials-help-customers-make-their-buying-decisions" class="headerlink" title="Video testimonials help customers make their buying decisions"></a>Video testimonials help customers make their buying decisions</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/help-customers-decisions.jpg"                      alt="help customers decisions"                ></p><p>Video testimonials are an amazing way to demonstrate the value of your business. They help customers make their buying decisions, they’re more effective than written testimonials, and they are more authentic and believable than the written ones.</p><p>Video testimonials help reinforce your company’s message. When you see a product or service demonstrated in action by someone who is actually using it in real life—which is what happens when you watch a video—you can get a much better understanding of what it does for people who experience it firsthand. This can make an enormous difference when trying to convey the benefits of something like an electric toothbrush or headphones compared to just reading about them on paper or hearing about them from someone else who may not be fully knowledgeable about how awesome these products really are!</p><p>It also helps build relationships with potential clients because videos allow us to connect with people on a personal level in ways that would otherwise be impossible through text-only formats such as email messages only ever so briefly exchanged between two parties before being quickly forgotten forever when we move onto other things.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1915825/19272" target="_top" id="1915825">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1915825" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1915825/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Video-testimonials-help-reinforce-your-company’s-message"><a href="#Video-testimonials-help-reinforce-your-company’s-message" class="headerlink" title="Video testimonials help reinforce your company’s message"></a>Video testimonials help reinforce your company’s message</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/reinforce-company-message.jpg"                      alt="reinforce company message"                ></p><p>Video testimonials are a great way to reinforce your company’s message and make potential customers feel like they know you, your business, and your products.</p><p>When customers see another person saying good things about their service, it makes them more likely to trust and use that service themselves. Video testimonials can help you reach a larger audience by being shared on social media, review sites, and other marketing channels.</p><p>If you want to build trust with your audience, having real people talk about their experiences in using your products is a great way to do it. Video testimonials can help you get more customers by showing them that other people have had good experiences with your product and that it does what it says it does. They can also help you sell more because when someone sees someone else saying how much they love a product, they will think “hey, maybe I should try this too.”</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="2135472">                    <video width="864" height="1536" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/2135472.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2135472">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/2135472.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Funicoeye.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F2135472%2F18498'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2135472/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Video-testimonials-are-more-authentic-and-believable-than-written-ones"><a href="#Video-testimonials-are-more-authentic-and-believable-than-written-ones" class="headerlink" title="Video testimonials are more authentic and believable than written ones"></a>Video testimonials are more authentic and believable than written ones</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/authentic-video-testimonial.jpg"                      alt="authentic video testimonial"                ></p><p>Of course, written testimonials are still a great way to get your message across.

One of the most interesting things you can include in your videos is a time lapse clip. Time lapses are videos where time seems to rush by quickly. Time lapse videos are often of things like the sun setting or traffic in the city and they are usually created by placing your camera in a stable spot, like on a tripod, and either setting it to record a video or to take pictures at regular intervals.</p><p>A hyperlapse is a special type of time lapse video where the camera changes positions. When you make a time lapse video you leave your camera in one spot. You might set it up in the window of a vehicle or on top of something that moves, but the camera stays in the spot where you mount it. When you create a hyperlapse video you manually move your camera to different positions.</p><h2 id="How-to-Make-A-Hyperlapse-Video-1"><a href="#How-to-Make-A-Hyperlapse-Video-1" class="headerlink" title="How to Make A Hyperlapse Video"></a>How to Make A Hyperlapse Video</h2><p>Time lapse videos are everywhere. Television shows often use time lapses and hyperlapses to establish locations. These usually include city skylines or recognizable landmarks. Time lapse and hyperlapse videos have also become popular on YouTube, Instagram, and other social media sites. Often people are creating them on their phones. This article will explain how.</p><h4 id="1-Apps-for-Creating-Hyperlapse-Videos"><a href="#1-Apps-for-Creating-Hyperlapse-Videos" class="headerlink" title="1. Apps for Creating Hyperlapse Videos"></a>1. Apps for Creating Hyperlapse Videos</h4><p>There are several apps for creating time lapse videos, and any of them can be used to create hyperlapses as well. Here are two of the best:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/hyperlapse-hyperlapse.JPG"                      alt="hyperlapse hyperlapse"                ></p><p><strong>Hyperlapse</strong> is also the name of an app created by Instagram for recording time lapse and hyperlapse videos. This app can record up to 45 minutes of footage and then compress it into a much shorter video. The thing that makes Hyperlapse especially good for hyperlapse videos is that it automatically helps to stabilize the footage you record while walking around. As Hyperlapse is an Instagram app all videos are cropped into square shapes. This app is only available for iOS devices.</p><p>Lapse It is a great app for users who want to have a lot of control over the look of their videos. Besides recording your hyperlapse video Lapse It allows you to do some editing, like trimming your clips or adding music and filters. You can even import hyperlapse videos recorded with other cameras into Lapse It. There is a free version of Lapse It and a ‘Pro’ version which has more features and costs $1.99. Both versions offer in-app purchases. Lapse It is available for both Android and iOS devices.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/hyperlapse-lapseit.JPG"                      alt="hyperlapse lapseit"                ></p><p>For more information on time lapse apps read the entry ‘Best Apps for Time Lapse Videos’.</p><h4 id="2-Hyperlapse-Videos-–-The-Long-Way"><a href="#2-Hyperlapse-Videos-–-The-Long-Way" class="headerlink" title="2. Hyperlapse Videos – The Long Way"></a>2. Hyperlapse Videos – The Long Way</h4><p>Some video creators prefer to create their hyperlapse videos from photographs they take outside of an app. This takes longer, but some people find it more rewarding. First, choose an interesting location to record your hyperlapse and decide on the path you are going to move along. Look at the frame of your first shot and pick out one detail, like a window on a building. When you move your camera try to keep that detail in the same part of your frame.</p><p>It may be helpful to set your phone up on a tripod or monopod to keep it at the right level and stop it from shaking while you take your photos. You could also place the handle of a selfie stick on the ground and use it as a monopod.</p><p>To create your hyperlapse you will need to take even steps and snap a photo every time you move. You will end up with a huge number of photos which you will need to edit and compile into a video.</p><p>It is a good idea to edit your photos in a program like Lightroom before importing them into a video editing program. In Lightroom you can edit only one image and apply the same specs to the rest.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Ollie Mattison</p><p>Ollie Mattison is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Ollie Mattison</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-rev-voice-recorder-review/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Rev Voice Recorder Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/ssential-10-history-youtube-feeds-for-learners/"><u>[New] Essential 10 History YouTube Feeds For Learners</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-iphone-macro-and-close-up-photography-tips/"><u>[Updated] IPhone Macro and Close-Up Photography Tips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-the-evolution-a-deep-dive-into-lgs-oled-monitors-ud88-w/"><u>[Updated] The Evolution A Deep Dive Into LG's OLED Monitors UD88-W</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/chucklecraft-sign-up-now-and-laugh-later/"><u>ChuckleCraft Sign Up Now & Laugh Later</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-issues.techidaily.com/enhancing-your-listening-experience-troubleshooting-windows-11s-audio-issues/"><u>Enhancing Your Listening Experience: Troubleshooting Windows 11'S Audio Issues</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/evaluating-safety-and-performance-the-complete-guide-to-anker-roav-dash-cam-c1/"><u>Evaluating Safety and Performance - The Complete Guide to Anker Roav Dash Cam C1</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/in-2024-sky-magnificence-in-focus-leading-websites-uncovered/"><u>In 2024, Sky Magnificence in Focus Leading Websites Uncovered</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/in-2024-unlocking-the-world-of-no-cost-picture-frame-movies/"><u>In 2024, Unlocking the World of No-Cost Picture Frame Movies</u></a></li></ul></div><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1868495/19272" target="_top" id="1868495">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1868495" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1868495/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->]]></content>

By slowing fast-moving subjects to a crawl and capturing the slightest details of movements that the human eyes can’t ordinarily notice, a slow-motion camera opens up a whole new universe of visual expression.</p><p>Let’s start off!</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="1-DJI-Pocket-2"><a href="#1-DJI-Pocket-2" class="headerlink" title="1. DJI Pocket 2"></a>1. DJI Pocket 2</h2><p>This adorable little camera is a dream come true for YouTube creators and bloggers, particularly those who have a passion for traveling and documenting experiences while they are on the move.</p><p>&gt;You have a large selection of different video options, including Pro modes, Time-lapse, Hyper-lapse, and a lot of other alternatives as well. This is a highly creative and versatile option. When recording in Full HD, you have the ability to select a frame rate of up to 240 frames per second (fps) for use in slow-motion effects.</p><p>There isn’t a whole lot that can be said about the Pocket 2, as far as its ability to produce professional-looking films complete with a variety of effects, all from a device that can be carried around in your pocket with relative ease.</p><p>Even though the DJI Osmo Pocket continues to be a good option for those on a tighter budget, we believe that the DJI Osmo Pocket 2, with its larger sensor, brighter lens, improved microphones, and wider field of view, is a worthy upgrade from its predecessor. This is especially true if you are looking for one of the top vlogging cameras.</p><p><strong>Price</strong>: $385.00</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/dji-pocket-2.jpg"                      alt="dji pocket 2"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2037350/7443" target="_top" id="2037350">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2037350" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2037350/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-Sony-Xperia-5-III"><a href="#2-Sony-Xperia-5-III" class="headerlink" title="2. Sony Xperia 5 III"></a>2. Sony Xperia 5 III</h2><p>The video expertise that Sony’s camera division has is brought over to its smartphone division, and as a result, the Sony Xperia 5 III is an amazing phone for videography and slow-motion video recording. If you utilize the more advanced Cinema Pro software, you will be able to film at a super-smooth frame rate of 120 frames per second, whilst the standard mode is fine for everyday use and will allow you to shoot in 4K at up to 30 frames per second.</p><p>Now, the Cinema Pro app isn’t for everyone because it was built to provide experienced users the ability to extensively tamper with video settings. As a result, first-time users may feel a little bit overwhelmed by the software’s features and options. This is an excellent option for you if you do not mind getting hands-on with the video settings on your device.</p><p>Because wireless charging was not included in the Xperia 5 III, like it was not included in the model that came before it, users will need to make some minor adjustments to their expectations regarding the equipment. The Xperia 5 III is a great option for consumers who want a high-end smartphone that is still relatively tiny and features a Snapdragon 888 system-on-chip.</p><p><strong>Price</strong>: $999.99</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/sony-xperia-5-iii.jpg"                      alt="sony xperia 5 iii"                ></p><h2 id="3-Canon-EOS-90D"><a href="#3-Canon-EOS-90D" class="headerlink" title="3. Canon EOS 90D"></a>3. Canon EOS 90D</h2><p>Anyone who likes to shoot a little bit of everything, including slow-motion, is a good candidate for this versatile and powerful all-rounder, which is a solid alternative. You’ll have the ability to record at frame rates of up to 120 fps in Full HD, with outstanding face and eye tracking that works effectively to deliver results that are crisp and clear.</p><p>&gt;The 90D is the one to look towards if it’s something you’re particularly interested in, especially if you’re eager to take advantage of the more extensive range of Canon lenses (opens in new tab) that are available for EF mount DSLRs. Several of the other cameras in Canon’s line up are limited to 720p for 120fps shooting, so the 90D is the one to look towards if it’s something you’re particularly interested in.</p><p>&gt;With other capabilities including as 4K recording, a headphone and mic port, this is a handy tool for making lots of different types of shot, using slow mo when necessary.</p><p>The Canon 90D has great image quality, especially at lower ISO settings. The photographs produced by the camera have a lot of clarity, colors that are attractive to the eye, and a decent dynamic range performance. Additionally, the camera has exceptional exposure and tonal adjustment versatility. However, similar to the sensors found in most Canon DSLRs, the sensor included in the 90D has a fixed optical low-pass filter.</p><p>The Canon 90D is versatile enough to be utilized for either formal portraiture or candid shots with friends and family. It has a good exposure latitude, which enables it to handle a broad variety of lighting circumstances in an effective manner. The EOS iTR AF face detection works really well to ensure that your subject’s eyes, which are the most crucial portion of the face, are caught with excellent sharpness.</p><p><strong>Price</strong>: $1,199.00</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/cannon-eos-90-d.jpg"                      alt="cannon eos 90 d"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1977004">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1977004.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1977004">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1977004.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1977004%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1977004/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-GoPro-Hero-10-Black"><a href="#4-GoPro-Hero-10-Black" class="headerlink" title="4. GoPro Hero 10 Black"></a>4. GoPro Hero 10 Black</h2><p>Because moving or action subjects are the most typical usage for slow-motion film, it makes sense to make an investment in an action camera to complete the job. GoPro is still the leader among action cameras, and its software offers a wide range of customization possibilities, allowing users to create a wide variety of special effects. The maximum frame rate that can be achieved in 4K is 120 fps, while 2.7K allows you to capture a spectacular 240 fps slow-mo, offering you an improvement in quality in comparison to Full HD.</p><p>This is an excellent choice for producing point-of-view (POV) slow-motion videos of your various excursions, such as mountain biking, surfing, and other similar activities. Because it has a number of different attachments and mounts, it is also one that you can easily transport from place to place.</p><p>The Hero10 can be submerged to a depth of 33 feet without requiring a protective casing, just like the other cameras in the Hero series. The official ‘Super Suit’ GoPro attachment that houses the Hero9 is the same case that you can use with the Hero10, and it has a depth rating of either 196 feet or 60 meters, whichever is greater.</p><p>You may avoid the problem by powering the GoPro through the USB-C port when you’re recording for a long period of time or by lowering the frame rate. During our testing conducted at room temperature, the Hero10 was able to continually record until its battery died at 5.3K24, which corresponds to a running time of close to 90 minutes.</p><p><strong>Price:</strong> $449.99</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/gopro-hero-10-black.jpg"                      alt="gopro hero 10 black"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://review-au.sjv.io/c/5597632/2098703/14409" target="_top" id="2098703">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14409-2098703" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="468" height="60"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://review-au.sjv.io/i/5597632/2098703/14409"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="5-Sony-ZV-1"><a href="#5-Sony-ZV-1" class="headerlink" title="5.

Do you want to fade in or out your video to black or white? Then, we have got you. Adobe Premiere Pro is one popular video editing software. Fading is every editor’s trump card, making it enjoyable to viewers by seamless scene transitions and some elements pop onto the screen. Fading is an effortless and beautiful effect that hep the clips to merge into the color of another clip smoothly. It is a way of telling viewers there is a visual change without explicitly telling them. The fade effect is in two forms fade in and fade out. Moreover, Fade-in appears at the beginning of the video and fade-out at the end of the video. And in this blog, we will discuss how to fade in Premiere Pro.</p><p>A fade-in refers to the technique that allows video&#x2F;image to emerge from the black, white, or any color background. In contrast, fade-out relates to the methods which will enable videos&#x2F;images to blend naturally into the black, white, or color background. We will also learn how to fade in video Premiere Pro.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [Fade Video Transition Premiere Pro](#Part 1)</p><p>02 [Fade In&#x2F;Out sound on Premiere Pro](#Part 2)</p><p>03 [Add Video fade in Premiere Pro](#Part 3)</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-Fade-Video-Transition-Premiere-Pro"><a href="#Part-1-Fade-Video-Transition-Premiere-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Fade Video Transition Premiere Pro"></a>Part 1 Fade Video Transition Premiere Pro</h2><p>Premiere Pro to add fade transition can be between clips to link and move from one shot to another shot smoothly. Premiere Pro offers many transition effects to edit the videos: Audio, Video, and VR.</p><p>Transitions are generally of two types; single-sided or double-sided transitions. Single-sided is when you have only a single clip. This image shows how the transition fades look. The double-sided transition will have a diagonal line, and the single-sided transition will have one-half light and the other half dark.</p><h5 id="Step1-Apply-Transition-between-the-clips"><a href="#Step1-Apply-Transition-between-the-clips" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Apply Transition between the clips"></a>Step1 Apply Transition between the clips</h5><p>Initially, you need to apply the transition to add fading effects. First, choose Window &gt; Effects. Expand the video or audio transitions, expand the bin containing the transition, and drag and drop the required transition between the two clips.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/apply-transition.jpg"                      alt="apply transition"                ></p><h5 id="Step2-Single-Sided-Transitions"><a href="#Step2-Single-Sided-Transitions" class="headerlink" title="Step2 Single-Sided Transitions"></a>Step2 Single-Sided Transitions</h5><p>When you place the transition on a single cut, click on Ctrl + drag on the transition to the timeline. Release the mouse when the “End at Cut” or “Start at Cut” icon appears.</p><p>End At Cut: Adjust the end transition at the end of the first clip</p><p>Start At Cut: Adjust the start of the transition at the beginning of the first clip. This is another method to add fade in the Premiere.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/start-and-end.jpg"                      alt="start and end"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Fade-In-Out-sound-on-Premiere-Pro"><a href="#Part-2-Fade-In-Out-sound-on-Premiere-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Fade In&#x2F;Out sound on Premiere Pro"></a>Part 2 Fade In&#x2F;Out sound on Premiere Pro</h2><p>Are you in doubt about how to fade background music in Premiere Pro? A crossfade is an essential tool for smooth video effects where viewers cannot notice any cuts between the videos, which can be valuable for both video and audio. There are two types of crossfading, either by using keyframes manually or using transitions pre-built in Premiere Pro.</p><p>Let’s learn how to add crossfade in Premiere. There are three types of crossfade available in the Premiere: constant gain, constant power, and exponential power to fade music. Lets us discuss how to add music fade in Premiere Pro.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/types-of-crossfade.jpg"                      alt="types of crossfade"                ></p><p>You can find these options in Effects &gt; Audio Transitions &gt; Crossfade available in the project panel. This is how to add a crossfade in Premiere with just three simple steps. There are three types of crossfade available in Premiere Pro, and below is a brief description of them.</p><h3 id="Constant-Gain"><a href="#Constant-Gain" class="headerlink" title="Constant Gain"></a>Constant Gain</h3><p>The constant gain crossfades are employed to vary the audio at a constant rate as it fades in and fades out at the transition between the clips. But sometimes, it is often abrupt. These are usually done manually using keyframes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/constant-gain.jpg"                      alt="constant gain"                ></p><p>But this constant gain generally seems to be noise and not smooth compared to continuous power. Let us discuss this next.</p><h3 id="Constant-Power"><a href="#Constant-Power" class="headerlink" title="Constant Power"></a>Constant Power</h3><p>Constant Power crossfade creates a smooth, gradual transition effect analogous to dissolve to the following clip compared to constant gain. Constant power fades in the audio effect initially and then fades out at the end of the clip. In the image, you can notice the keyframes have gradually decreased in the first clip and steadily increased at the end of the second clip.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/constant-power.jpg"                      alt="constant power"                ></p><p>Compared to all other crossfades, constant power is the best audio crossfade. This will be giving a more smoothing effect and gradual shift in gain between the clips, nothing more apparent changes during the transition. This is how to fade in sound on Premiere Pro using constant power crossfade.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1925484/19272" target="_top" id="1925484">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1925484" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1925484/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Exponential-Fade"><a href="#Exponential-Fade" class="headerlink" title="Exponential Fade"></a>Exponential Fade</h3><p>Exponential Fade is opposite to constant power. It fades out the first clip and disappears in the second clip, which brings a smooth logarithmic curve. This is how to add exponential Fade in Premiere Pro to the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/exponential-fade.jpg"                      alt="exponential fade"                ></p><p>Thus, now you know how to add crossfade in Premiere Pro smoothly.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Add-Video-fade-in-Premiere-Pro"><a href="#Part-3-Add-Video-fade-in-Premiere-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Add Video fade in Premiere Pro"></a>Part 3 Add Video fade in Premiere Pro</h2><p>When we want to add a black color between two videos for smooth movements, the best idea is to fade-in and fade-out. In Premiere Pro, you will not find a fade option directly. It will appear as Film Dissolve in the settings of the Premiere Pro dashboard. Below is an example clip of how the video will look if you add black color fading effects.

Drag the Effect onto the video portion in the Timeline to create a fade-in effect drop at the beginning of the clip. To create a fade-out effect, drop at the end of the clip. After everything is automatic, you can clip on the Play button to see its action.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/applying-film-dissolve.jpg"                      alt="applying film dissolve"                ></p><h5 id="Step-3-Change-length-of-the-Fade-in-and-out-effects"><a href="#Step-3-Change-length-of-the-Fade-in-and-out-effects" class="headerlink" title="Step 3 Change length of the Fade in and out effects"></a>Step 3 Change length of the Fade in and out effects</h5><p>It is possible to change the length of the Fade in and out effects after the film dissolve is applied. You can notice that the Fade gets added between the clip. Inside the video, there is a small box. You can click on it drag their edges to increase the duration of the fade-in&#x2F;out in the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/change-length.jpg"                      alt="change length"                ></p><p>Short video transitions are the best between the clips for most transitions.

Do you want to fade in or out your video to black or white? Then, we have got you. Adobe Premiere Pro is one popular video editing software. Fading is every editor’s trump card, making it enjoyable to viewers by seamless scene transitions and some elements pop onto the screen. Fading is an effortless and beautiful effect that hep the clips to merge into the color of another clip smoothly. It is a way of telling viewers there is a visual change without explicitly telling them. The fade effect is in two forms fade in and fade out. Moreover, Fade-in appears at the beginning of the video and fade-out at the end of the video. And in this blog, we will discuss how to fade in Premiere Pro.</p><p>A fade-in refers to the technique that allows video&#x2F;image to emerge from the black, white, or any color background. In contrast, fade-out relates to the methods which will enable videos&#x2F;images to blend naturally into the black, white, or color background. We will also learn how to fade in video Premiere Pro.</p><h4 id="In-this-article-1"><a href="#In-this-article-1" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [Fade Video Transition Premiere Pro](#Part 1)</p><p>02 [Fade In&#x2F;Out sound on Premiere Pro](#Part 2)</p><p>03 [Add Video fade in Premiere Pro](#Part 3)</p><h2 id="Part-1-Fade-Video-Transition-Premiere-Pro-1"><a href="#Part-1-Fade-Video-Transition-Premiere-Pro-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Fade Video Transition Premiere Pro"></a>Part 1 Fade Video Transition Premiere Pro</h2><p>Premiere Pro to add fade transition can be between clips to link and move from one shot to another shot smoothly. Premiere Pro offers many transition effects to edit the videos: Audio, Video, and VR.</p><p>Transitions are generally of two types; single-sided or double-sided transitions. Single-sided is when you have only a single clip. This image shows how the transition fades look. The double-sided transition will have a diagonal line, and the single-sided transition will have one-half light and the other half dark.</p><h5 id="Step1-Apply-Transition-between-the-clips-1"><a href="#Step1-Apply-Transition-between-the-clips-1" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Apply Transition between the clips"></a>Step1 Apply Transition between the clips</h5><p>Initially, you need to apply the transition to add fading effects. First, choose Window &gt; Effects. Expand the video or audio transitions, expand the bin containing the transition, and drag and drop the required transition between the two clips.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/apply-transition.jpg"                      alt="apply transition"                ></p><h5 id="Step2-Single-Sided-Transitions-1"><a href="#Step2-Single-Sided-Transitions-1" class="headerlink" title="Step2 Single-Sided Transitions"></a>Step2 Single-Sided Transitions</h5><p>When you place the transition on a single cut, click on Ctrl + drag on the transition to the timeline. Release the mouse when the “End at Cut” or “Start at Cut” icon appears.</p><p>End At Cut: Adjust the end transition at the end of the first clip</p><p>Start At Cut: Adjust the start of the transition at the beginning of the first clip.

A crossfade is an essential tool for smooth video effects where viewers cannot notice any cuts between the videos, which can be valuable for both video and audio. There are two types of crossfading, either by using keyframes manually or using transitions pre-built in Premiere Pro.</p><p>Let’s learn how to add crossfade in Premiere. There are three types of crossfade available in the Premiere: constant gain, constant power, and exponential power to fade music. Lets us discuss how to add music fade in Premiere Pro.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/types-of-crossfade.jpg"                      alt="types of crossfade"                ></p><p>You can find these options in Effects &gt; Audio Transitions &gt; Crossfade available in the project panel. This is how to add a crossfade in Premiere with just three simple steps. There are three types of crossfade available in Premiere Pro, and below is a brief description of them.</p><h3 id="Constant-Gain-1"><a href="#Constant-Gain-1" class="headerlink" title="Constant Gain"></a>Constant Gain</h3><p>The constant gain crossfades are employed to vary the audio at a constant rate as it fades in and fades out at the transition between the clips. But sometimes, it is often abrupt. These are usually done manually using keyframes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/constant-gain.jpg"                      alt="constant gain"                ></p><p>But this constant gain generally seems to be noise and not smooth compared to continuous power. Let us discuss this next.</p><h3 id="Constant-Power-1"><a href="#Constant-Power-1" class="headerlink" title="Constant Power"></a>Constant Power</h3><p>Constant Power crossfade creates a smooth, gradual transition effect analogous to dissolve to the following clip compared to constant gain. Constant power fades in the audio effect initially and then fades out at the end of the clip. In the image, you can notice the keyframes have gradually decreased in the first clip and steadily increased at the end of the second clip.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/constant-power.jpg"                      alt="constant power"                ></p><p>Compared to all other crossfades, constant power is the best audio crossfade. This will be giving a more smoothing effect and gradual shift in gain between the clips, nothing more apparent changes during the transition. This is how to fade in sound on Premiere Pro using constant power crossfade.</p><h3 id="Exponential-Fade-1"><a href="#Exponential-Fade-1" class="headerlink" title="Exponential Fade"></a>Exponential Fade</h3><p>Exponential Fade is opposite to constant power. It fades out the first clip and disappears in the second clip, which brings a smooth logarithmic curve. This is how to add exponential Fade in Premiere Pro to the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/exponential-fade.jpg"                      alt="exponential fade"                ></p><p>Thus, now you know how to add crossfade in Premiere Pro smoothly.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Add-Video-fade-in-Premiere-Pro-1"><a href="#Part-3-Add-Video-fade-in-Premiere-Pro-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Add Video fade in Premiere Pro"></a>Part 3 Add Video fade in Premiere Pro</h2><p>When we want to add a black color between two videos for smooth movements, the best idea is to fade-in and fade-out. In Premiere Pro, you will not find a fade option directly. It will appear as Film Dissolve in the settings of the Premiere Pro dashboard. Below is an example clip of how the video will look if you add black color fading effects. Let us discuss how to add video fade in Premiere Pro.</p><h5 id="Step-1-Choose-the-effect-1"><a href="#Step-1-Choose-the-effect-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 1 Choose the effect"></a>Step 1 Choose the effect</h5><p>To add fade in Premiere Pro, navigate Effects &gt; Video Transitions &gt; Dissolve &gt; Film Dissolve.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/film-dissolve.jpg"                      alt="film dissolve"                ></p><p>Fade in and out can be done using Film Dissolve found in the Video transitions folder.</p><h5 id="Step-2-Appling-Fade-in-out-1"><a href="#Step-2-Appling-Fade-in-out-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 2 Appling Fade in&#x2F;out"></a>Step 2 Appling Fade in&#x2F;out</h5><p>In Adobe Premiere, add Fade in or out, click and hold on Film Dissolve effect. Drag the Effect onto the video portion in the Timeline to create a fade-in effect drop at the beginning of the clip. To create a fade-out effect, drop at the end of the clip. After everything is automatic, you can clip on the Play button to see its action.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/applying-film-dissolve.jpg"                      alt="applying film dissolve"                ></p><h5 id="Step-3-Change-length-of-the-Fade-in-and-out-effects-1"><a href="#Step-3-Change-length-of-the-Fade-in-and-out-effects-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 3 Change length of the Fade in and out effects"></a>Step 3 Change length of the Fade in and out effects</h5><p>It is possible to change the length of the Fade in and out effects after the film dissolve is applied. You can notice that the Fade gets added between the clip. Inside the video, there is a small box.

There are three types of crossfade available in Premiere Pro, and below is a brief description of them.</p><h3 id="Constant-Gain-2"><a href="#Constant-Gain-2" class="headerlink" title="Constant Gain"></a>Constant Gain</h3><p>The constant gain crossfades are employed to vary the audio at a constant rate as it fades in and fades out at the transition between the clips. But sometimes, it is often abrupt. These are usually done manually using keyframes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/constant-gain.jpg"                      alt="constant gain"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2080333/19272" target="_top" id="2080333">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2080333" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2080333/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>But this constant gain generally seems to be noise and not smooth compared to continuous power. Let us discuss this next.</p><h3 id="Constant-Power-2"><a href="#Constant-Power-2" class="headerlink" title="Constant Power"></a>Constant Power</h3><p>Constant Power crossfade creates a smooth, gradual transition effect analogous to dissolve to the following clip compared to constant gain. Constant power fades in the audio effect initially and then fades out at the end of the clip. In the image, you can notice the keyframes have gradually decreased in the first clip and steadily increased at the end of the second clip.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/constant-power.jpg"                      alt="constant power"                ></p><p>Compared to all other crossfades, constant power is the best audio crossfade. This will be giving a more smoothing effect and gradual shift in gain between the clips, nothing more apparent changes during the transition. This is how to fade in sound on Premiere Pro using constant power crossfade.</p><h3 id="Exponential-Fade-2"><a href="#Exponential-Fade-2" class="headerlink" title="Exponential Fade"></a>Exponential Fade</h3><p>Exponential Fade is opposite to constant power. It fades out the first clip and disappears in the second clip, which brings a smooth logarithmic curve. This is how to add exponential Fade in Premiere Pro to the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/exponential-fade.jpg"                      alt="exponential fade"                ></p><p>Thus, now you know how to add crossfade in Premiere Pro smoothly.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Add-Video-fade-in-Premiere-Pro-2"><a href="#Part-3-Add-Video-fade-in-Premiere-Pro-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Add Video fade in Premiere Pro"></a>Part 3 Add Video fade in Premiere Pro</h2><p>When we want to add a black color between two videos for smooth movements, the best idea is to fade-in and fade-out.
