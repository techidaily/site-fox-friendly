This puts no effect on the photo and helps the user display the whole idea with prominence.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/edit-text-in-image-11.jpg"                      alt="add text in negative space"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135362/19272" target="_top" id="2135362">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135362" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135362/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-Framing-the-Text-3"><a href="#4-Framing-the-Text-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Framing the Text"></a>4. Framing the Text</h3><p>If you go for prominence, you should always use elements that are meant for bringing prominence. Text that is to be highlighted with purity across a photo should be framed rather than any other tactful technique. This helps you create a clear focal point while sustaining the quality of the image. Following this, it also keeps a good view across the photo as a subjective associate picture.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/edit-text-in-image-12.jpg"                      alt="frame the text"                ></p><h3 id="5-Control-your-Sizes-and-Styles-3"><a href="#5-Control-your-Sizes-and-Styles-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Control your Sizes and Styles"></a>5. Control your Sizes and Styles</h3><p>Make sure that you always select a font size or style that is relevant to the photo. The use of inappropriate sizes and styles in photos takes away the essence of the picture. A balance across these traits is essential for the user to bring. Capture the viewers’ attention without compromising the quality of the photo itself.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/edit-text-in-image-13.jpg"                      alt="select accurate font size and style"                ></p><h2 id="The-Bottom-Line-3"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line-3" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h2><p>The best illustration of images is not possible without adding typography to them.

Whether you are an adventure sport enthusiast looking to immortalize every moment during high speed jumping, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >diving <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, skiing experience, or looking forward to produce documentary-style motion videos, the action camera is the most precious possession.</p><p> GoPro has been dominating the market for over a decade, now due to its popularity among professionals, availability of compatible <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >accessories <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and above all its quality. However, before buying, it is worth looking at some other brands (though less popular compared to GoPro) featuring wonderful technical specifications at affordable prices.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Factors-to-Consider-When-Buying-Your-Action-or-Sports-Camera"><a href="#Factors-to-Consider-When-Buying-Your-Action-or-Sports-Camera" class="headerlink" title="Factors to Consider When Buying Your Action or Sports Camera"></a>Factors to Consider When Buying Your Action or Sports Camera</h2><p> Those who are novice to the concept of motion video and photography should consider the following aspects seriously while choosing their action camera.</p><p><strong>Cost of the Camera:</strong> Your budget determines the actual range while looking for the action cameras. Ideally, it can be hard to find a GoPro under $100. Even a basic model is priced at $130. While preparing a budget, you must also consider a checklist of supportive accessories and their prices.</p><p><strong>Supportive Accessories:</strong> Though the manufacturers provide some basic gears such as waterproof housing with the camera, it is always necessary to purchase the most compatible high quality accessories that fit your camera best. Some basic requirements include mounts, tripods, filters, extended life batteries etc.</p><p><strong>Camera Specifications and Features:</strong> At the end of the day, your picture or video quality is the main thing that matters. Decide what quality picture resolution or video shooting do you intend to achieve. Consider choosing highest pixel for photos and 4k resolution for best results with final edited video.</p><p><strong>Weather Resistance Protection:</strong> Your action camera is exposed to moisture and fluctuating temperatures often. Your camera should have a waterproof housing or water resistant protection support to ensure greater durability.</p><p><strong>Camera Shape, Dimension and Weight:</strong> The action camera is mostly mounted on the photographer’s body during high-speed mobility. Choose a camera with extremely compact design (preferably box shaped) and lightweight model for convenient mounting.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1934138/19272" target="_top" id="1934138">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1934138" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1934138/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Top-6-Cheapest-Action-Cameras-to-Buy-Under-100-1"><a href="#Top-6-Cheapest-Action-Cameras-to-Buy-Under-100-1" class="headerlink" title="Top 6 Cheapest Action Cameras to Buy Under $100"></a>Top 6 Cheapest Action Cameras to Buy Under $100</h2><h4 id="1-Polaroid-Cube-HD-1080p-Lifestyle-Action-Camera-99-99"><a href="#1-Polaroid-Cube-HD-1080p-Lifestyle-Action-Camera-99-99" class="headerlink" title="1.

Thus, go along the steps to get the method learned.</p><p>Firstly, open the iMovie app on your device and go to the “Project” section which is located at the top screen.</p><p>Next, you need to tap on the “Create Project” which is available as a ‘+’ icon. Afterward, you will notice two panels namely, ‘Movie” and “Trailer”. Choose the former one followed by tapping on the “Create” option.</p><p>When this is done, your project interface will be on the screen. Subsequently, go to the “Media” icon located at the top left corner at the timeline. The videos gallery will appear on the screen. Choose one in which you want to add the music and tap on the “Add” icon. The source video will now add to the timeline of iMovie.</p><p>Scroll the timeline to the initial point of the video in order to add the music at the point.</p><p>Now you can add music by following the same procedure that we did for adding video from the gallery. This will add the music successfully. Please make sure to place the music at background if you want low volume music. The “Background” option will be at the bottom of the screen.</p><p>Now, tap the “Play” button to preview the video along with the music. Once satisfied, tap on “Done” placed at the left corner of the screen.</p><p>Tip: If your video’s duration is more than the audio duration, iMovie will automatically loop the background music. Therefore, there is an option to adjust the length of the media file. You can set it according to your preference.

In the following part, I’ll take Filmora for Windows as an example to illustrate <strong>how to add music to iPhone videos.</strong> The steps on Filmora for Mac are similar.</p><p>Step 1 – Import iPhone Videos to Filmora</p><p>Launch Wondershare Filmora and begin with importing the iPhone source video file to Filmora. Choose “Import” and then go to the “Import from a Camera or a Phone” option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-from-camera-phone-filmora.jpg"                      alt="import iPhone videos to Filmora"                ></p><p>Tips: if your videos are shot vertically and you want to edit them in the 9:16 aspect ratio, you’ll need to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >adjust the aspect ratio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in Project settings.</p><p>In the pop-up window, choose the device, preview and check the media that you want to add music to. Those media will be saved in the default folder, and click OK to continue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-import-from-device.jpg"                      alt="import iPhone videos to Filmora window"                ></p><p>All imported media will be placed in the Project Media Library, you can then drag and drop them to the video track on the timeline.</p><p>Step 2 – Add Music and Sound Effect to Video</p><p>Filmora features an Audio Library which contains royalty-free music tracks and sound effects to choose from. Go for the one you find pleasant and drop it to the Audio track on the timeline. If you want to add your own music, you can simply import the files using the “My music” option on the left toolbar.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-audio-library.jpg"                      alt="Filmora Audio Library"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2012429/19272" target="_top" id="2012429">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2012429" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2012429/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Step 3 – Edit Soundtrack</p><p>Prior to the finalization of the video, you can also edit the soundtrack for example; you can speed up the sound or <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >add fade in&#x2F;out effect. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> You can also start equalizer etc.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audio-editing-panel.jpg"                      alt="edit sound in Filmora"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134500/19576" target="_top" id="2134500">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19576-2134500" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134500/19576"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Step 4 – Export the Video File</p><p>When you are done with everything, it’s time to export your creation.

When you post your own unique brand of wit and humor in the form of memes, remember to do the same for other people. With the help of this article, you can quickly and effortlessly transform a memorable occasion into a meme that will spread like wildfire.</p><p>Let’s start off!</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="1-What-exactly-is-a-meme"><a href="#1-What-exactly-is-a-meme" class="headerlink" title="1. What exactly is a meme?"></a>1. What exactly is a meme?</h2><p>A meme is an image that is passed around online and is accompanied by some form of writing. These memes typically offer sharp criticism on cultural icons, societal concepts, or current events. A meme is often an image or a video, although it can also take the form of a string of words in some cases. When a meme strikes a chord with a large number of people, it begins to circulate through various social platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, messaging, and other methods. The more the number of times a meme is shared, the more of an impact it has on culture.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/grandpa-meme-image.jpg"                      alt="grandpa meme image"                ></p><h2 id="2-When-did-memes-become-a-thing-online"><a href="#2-When-did-memes-become-a-thing-online" class="headerlink" title="2. When did memes become a thing online?"></a>2. When did memes become a thing online?</h2><p>Memes, which originated as an idea conceived from an improbable source, have emerged as one of the key modes of communication that are used on the internet. Memes have almost completely taken over popular culture, and they can be found just about anywhere. Your favorite artist, a member of your family, or even a politician may be the one who spreads them. Anything, even humans, has the potential to spread virally and turn into a meme. If you get extremely lucky, becoming a meme can even make you famous.</p><p>At one point in time, many believed that memes were nothing more than strange visuals that certain portions of the internet created for their own amusement. They are now an integral element of the typical engagement that takes place on social media and are utilized, shared, and consumed on a minute-to-minute basis. They can take something as harmless as the children’s show Arthur and turn the visuals into something that causes the authors of the series to issue an apology, or they can make fun of the very idea of possessing a certain guitar model.</p><p>People’s lives are becoming increasingly influenced by the internet and various forms of social media, which has coincided with the proliferation of memes in popular culture. Memes have evolved into the ideal medium for disseminating knowledge, comedic content, and political viewpoints as the amount of time spent online continues to rise. Memes have evolved from simple image changes made with the intention of making people laugh into rhetorical devices that are capable of spreading information to millions of people. As a result, memes have established themselves as one of the most important mediums in today’s society. This is how the meme has progressed over time.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/create-an-online-meme.jpg"                      alt="create an online meme"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1884017/19272" target="_top" id="1884017">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1884017" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1884017/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-How-do-you-make-a-meme"><a href="#3-How-do-you-make-a-meme" class="headerlink" title="3.

They’re also really simple to create! No prior tool experience is necessary. Absolutely! Use <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora’s <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> GIF function to quickly convert any video clip into an animated GIF meme that you can share with others.</p><h2 id="4-Researching-trending-memes"><a href="#4-Researching-trending-memes" class="headerlink" title="4. Researching trending memes"></a>4. Researching trending memes</h2><p>Through the years, many different styles of memes have come and gone. You don’t want to rely on methods that have since become obsolete. Do some research to find out what’s trending by looking through old memes. Also, pay attention to the memes that other people are posting wherever it is on the internet that you spend the majority of your time. It doesn’t matter if it’s Reddit, Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter.</p><p>Try to locate recent memes by browsing subreddits such as r&#x2F;memes and r&#x2F;dankmemes. In addition, there are times when a particular category of meme becomes popular. In that case, you should give those memes a shot and see if you can make them. For instance, Bernie Sanders was a topic of conversation for a few days not too long ago.</p><h2 id="5-Share-your-meme"><a href="#5-Share-your-meme" class="headerlink" title="5. Share your meme"></a>5. Share your meme</h2><p>You are now equipped with everything you require to begin creating hilarious memes. To review, you are now familiar with the process of creating a meme by either using a meme template that is blank so that you may add new meme captions or by making use of a screenshot tool to generate an entirely new meme.</p><p>If neither of these techniques works for you, another option is to use image editing software to generate new memes by uploading your own images or creating new memes from existing ones. When it comes to creating and distributing your very own memes, the number of options that are available to you is virtually limitless. Also, who knows, maybe you’ll come up with the next meme that becomes popular!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/share-your-meme-image.jpg"                      alt="share your meme image"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/c/5597632/2129041/19576" target="_top" id="2129041">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19576-2129041" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/i/5597632/2129041/19576"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1982485">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982485.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1982485">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982485.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1982485%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1982485/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>And that’s it!

And with refers to my YouTube Channel, the kind of haul that I usually shared with my audiences are something that I bought from different stores and places here in Israel. Kind of interesting, isn’t it? Most specially if you’re someone residing outside of the Holy Land. There are lots of interesting stuff to purchase here like souvenirs from the Old City of Jerusalem.</p><p>People nowadays are searching for something that they want to buy from the wide range of worldly goods out there. And that’s where the Youtubers&#x2F; vloggers came in. They share their videos on YouTube wherein viewers can get some sort of review with a particular item. Like for example, I bought a t-shirt from the Old City of Jerusalem. I’ll show the t-shirt itself; I’ll tell what kind of fabric it has. Is it good or not in my own opinion. Where can someone buy it and how much does it cost? So, from there; viewers can decide for themselves if they’re going to purchase that particular t-shirt in the future or not.</p><h2 id="Things-that-you-need-if-you-want-to-make-a-haul-video"><a href="#Things-that-you-need-if-you-want-to-make-a-haul-video" class="headerlink" title="Things that you need if you want to make a haul video"></a>Things that you need if you want to make a haul video</h2><p>That’s very simple.

Back in the days defining the internet was practically impossible, but people had an idea of what it would bring. However, Metaverse goes hand in hand with the avatar Metaverse.</p><p>As the name Meta suggests, Metaverse refers to a digital reality whose main objective is to blend in virtual reality, augmented reality, social media platforms, cryptocurrencies, and online gaming. Of course, we currently have platforms that feature avatars and virtual identities, but they include one flaw: all these features work on the same platform. This individuality syndrome is what Metaverse wishes to solve.</p><p>In our case, we are discussing the <strong>Metaverse Avatar</strong> and the most straightforward way to create one. Join us as we walk on the journey to creating a Metaverse avatar in the simplest way possible.

When Metaverse Avatar comes about, think of an icon representing you in the VR (Virtual Reality). Therefore, as technical experts talk of Metaverse, an avatar is equally essential. Why? Because it is what you use to identify yourself in the digital world.</p><p>Think of it in the sense of how you go about opening a social media account. Typically, you will upload your photo as a visual representation of yourself on the platform. The same case happens when dealing with Metaverse; you need an avatar. However, in this case, you don’t need your real photo since you settle for a figure where you dress it and design it as per your taste and preference.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/what-is-an-avatar.jpg"                      alt="what is an avatar"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-What-does-Avatar-Mean-to-Metaverse"><a href="#Part-2-What-does-Avatar-Mean-to-Metaverse" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What does Avatar Mean to Metaverse?"></a>Part 2: What does Avatar Mean to Metaverse?</h2><p>As mentioned above, Metaverse is a technological evolution aiming to blend various platforms such as video games and social media and allow people to interact with each other efficiently.

And this is the area that this section wishes to address.</p><p>What is the importance of Avatars for the Metaverse community? Avatars refer to various individuals’ representations when dealing with the digital world. In simple terms, you use an avatar in place of you in the virtual world. Avatar Metaverse gives the users a sense of identity while navigating through the internet. With the help of an avatar, you express your identity to the online community.</p><p>However, note that the critical feature in Avatars that makes it extremely important in Metaverse is interoperability is the ability for the avatars to communicate between various platforms easily. For example, when you buy things for your Avatar, this feature allows you to move around multiple online platforms with these changes. Avatars in Metaverse give a sense of togetherness in the virtual world.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-avatar-look-like.jpg"                      alt="how avatar"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Create-Metaverse-Avatar-with-Ease"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Create-Metaverse-Avatar-with-Ease" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Create Metaverse Avatar with Ease?"></a>Part 3: How to Create Metaverse Avatar with Ease?</h2><p>If you have heard about Metaverse avatars, you probably have ideas of what you figure you want the virtual world to use when recognizing you.

Resavr</h3><p>Resavr is another simple tool that instantly displays deleted comments on Reddit.</p><p>It’s pretty similar to the other tools, except it only reveals comments, not Reddit posts. However, Resavr can display comments much longer than 650 words, while some tools can’t do this.</p><p>Here’s how to use this simple tool. It only takes a few seconds:</p><p>Step1 Go to Resavr.com</p><p>Step2 Type in a keyword in the top-right corner search bar</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/resavr-search-bar.png"                      alt="resavr home page"                ></p><p>Step3 It will display a list of Google results with Reddit posts that have deleted comments</p><p>The main disadvantage of Resavr is its search feature. There’s no way to search for a specific Reddit post. Instead, you can only view recent posts with deleted comments. Or you can type in a specific word and go through all the posts that pop up to find what you’re looking for.</p><h3 id="4-The-Wayback-Machine"><a href="#4-The-Wayback-Machine" class="headerlink" title="4. The Wayback Machine"></a>4. The Wayback Machine</h3><p>The Wayback Machine is a powerful tool that stores archives of other websites’ caches. It’s a non-profit site that lets you see deleted Reddit posts and comments that have been stored in the past.</p><p>It’s a bit more complicated to use, but it offers fantastic results. So, here’s what you need to do:</p><p>Step1 Visit archive.org. (Wayback Machine’s official website)</p><p>Step2 Paste the link to the deleted post and hit “Enter”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/wayback-machine-search-bar.png"                      alt="wayback machine search bar"                ></p><p>Step3 Wayback Machine will display the results in a calendar format. Click on a date to see all deleted posts on that day in history.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/wayback-machine-search-results.png"                      alt="result page on wayback machine website"                ></p><p>Wayback Machine is a little slower when loading the results than other tools. But it gives you a comprehensive list of all the deleted content highlighted when it loads.</p><p>There is another downside. This tool doesn’t archive everything instantly. So, there is a chance that some posts won’t pop up if a Reddit moderator deleted the post before Wayback Machine could archive it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1934138/19272" target="_top" id="1934138">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1934138" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1934138/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="5-Google-Cache"><a href="#5-Google-Cache" class="headerlink" title="5. Google Cache"></a>5. Google Cache</h3><p>Last but not least, it’s the Google Cache method. This isn’t so much a tool as it is a way to reveal deleted Reddit posts. It won’t go as far back in time as Wayback Machine to display deleted Reddit posts. It only shows recently deleted ones.</p><p>On the bright side, this method is straightforward to use. All you need to do is:</p><p>Step1 Search for the deleted Reddit post on Google</p><p>Step2 When you find the result, click on the three dots next to the page’s link</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/google-cache-method.png"                      alt="google search result three dots"                ></p><p>Step3 Then, select “Cached” from the small new window that pops up</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/google-cached-button.png"                      alt="google search result cached feature"                ></p><p>This takes you to a previous version of the page when Google bots last visited it. Hopefully, this was when the post wasn’t yet deleted. You can’t know until you see the page and check it out.</p><p>Google Cache can be either a huge win or a total failure. It depends on the post itself. If it works, it will show you everything. However, if you’re too late to the party, you won’t be able to see anything from the deleted post.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Being able to see deleted posts on Reddit can be tricky. Reddit doesn’t allow this, but it often gets overlooked, thanks to some of the tools we’ve discussed here. Even though it’s not permitted, sometimes we all want to read a post we saved a while ago.</p><p>Just remember, these tools can often stop working. This is because they don’t meet Reddit’s guidelines and run without the company’s permission. It’s not illegal or anything, but it just may crash and not display your desired results. Use them while you can and find deleted Reddit posts you want to check out.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p>5 Ways to See Deleted Reddit Posts</p><h3 id="1-Unddit-1"><a href="#1-Unddit-1" class="headerlink" title="1.

(Wayback Machine’s official website)</p><p>Step2 Paste the link to the deleted post and hit “Enter”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/wayback-machine-search-bar.png"                      alt="wayback machine search bar"                ></p><p>Step3 Wayback Machine will display the results in a calendar format. Click on a date to see all deleted posts on that day in history.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/wayback-machine-search-results.png"                      alt="result page on wayback machine website"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1934183/19272" target="_top" id="1934183">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1934183" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1934183/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Wayback Machine is a little slower when loading the results than other tools. But it gives you a comprehensive list of all the deleted content highlighted when it loads.</p><p>There is another downside. This tool doesn’t archive everything instantly. So, there is a chance that some posts won’t pop up if a Reddit moderator deleted the post before Wayback Machine could archive it.</p><h3 id="5-Google-Cache-1"><a href="#5-Google-Cache-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Google Cache"></a>5. Google Cache</h3><p>Last but not least, it’s the Google Cache method. This isn’t so much a tool as it is a way to reveal deleted Reddit posts. It won’t go as far back in time as Wayback Machine to display deleted Reddit posts. It only shows recently deleted ones.</p><p>On the bright side, this method is straightforward to use. All you need to do is:</p><p>Step1 Search for the deleted Reddit post on Google</p><p>Step2 When you find the result, click on the three dots next to the page’s link</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/google-cache-method.png"                      alt="google search result three dots"                ></p><p>Step3 Then, select “Cached” from the small new window that pops up</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/google-cached-button.png"                      alt="google search result cached feature"                ></p><p>This takes you to a previous version of the page when Google bots last visited it. Hopefully, this was when the post wasn’t yet deleted. You can’t know until you see the page and check it out.</p><p>Google Cache can be either a huge win or a total failure. It depends on the post itself. If it works, it will show you everything. However, if you’re too late to the party, you won’t be able to see anything from the deleted post.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Being able to see deleted posts on Reddit can be tricky. Reddit doesn’t allow this, but it often gets overlooked, thanks to some of the tools we’ve discussed here. Even though it’s not permitted, sometimes we all want to read a post we saved a while ago.</p><p>Just remember, these tools can often stop working. This is because they don’t meet Reddit’s guidelines and run without the company’s permission. It’s not illegal or anything, but it just may crash and not display your desired results. Use them while you can and find deleted Reddit posts you want to check out.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-best-slow-motion-cameras/"><u>[New] Best Slow-Motion Cameras</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-streamlined-guide-5-efficient-windows-11-audio-recording-tips-for-2024/"><u>[New] Streamlined Guide 5 Efficient Windows 11 Audio Recording Tips for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/updated-adding-music-mini-banners-on-instagram-profiles-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Adding Music Mini-Banners on Instagram Profiles for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-frugal-flight-experts-choice-under-500-drone-guide-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Frugal Flight Experts' Choice Under $500 Drone Guide for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/ed-mastering-adsense-on-youtube-a-beginners-guide/"><u>[Updated] Mastering AdSense on YouTube A Beginner's Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-ultimate-clearer-eliminate-backgrounds-effectively-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Ultimate Clearer Eliminate Backgrounds Effectively for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/2024-approved-brain-snatching-battlegrounds-the-best-zombie-gaming-showdowns/"><u>2024 Approved Brain-Snatching Battlegrounds The Best Zombie Gaming Showdowns</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-files.techidaily.com/2024-approved-unlocking-the-potential-of-your-online-persona-on-facebook/"><u>2024 Approved Unlocking the Potential of Your Online Persona on Facebook</u></a></li><li><a href="https://driver-download.techidaily.com/approach-evaluate-how-these-devices-interact-with-structural-elements-during-an-earthquake/"><u>Approach: Evaluate How These Devices Interact with Structural Elements During an Earthquake</u></a></li><li><a href="https://hardware-updates.techidaily.com/download-drivers-for-hp-color-laserjet-pro-m452dn-printer/"><u>Download Drivers for HP Color LaserJet Pro M452dn Printer</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/mastering-podcast-xml-creating-rss-feeds-from-scratch/"><u>Mastering Podcast XML Creating RSS Feeds From Scratch</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-tricks.techidaily.com/usbcmdwindows/"><u>USBデバイスのフォーマット後、CMDを利用してWindows上でファイルを回復する手順</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Given the way Microsoft has added powerful features to Photos, it has the capability to offer much more to users. One such feature is the option to add the effect of slow motion in Windows 10 using the Photos app. We will explain how you can use the slow motion feature in Photos, along with an option to add the effect of slow motion online.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1"><strong>Part1: How to Use Slow Motion in Windows 10</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part2"><strong>Part2: Customizing the Slow Motion Effect</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part3"><strong>Part3: How to Edit in Slow Motion Online</strong></a></li></ul><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1：How-to-Use-Slow-Motion-in-Windows-10"><a href="#Part-1：How-to-Use-Slow-Motion-in-Windows-10" class="headerlink" title="Part 1：How to Use Slow Motion in Windows 10"></a>Part 1：How to Use Slow Motion in Windows 10</h2><p>There is no need to spend hundreds of dollars on a video program if you need to perform some basic editing and effects on your videos. For instance, you can add the slow motion effect using the Photos app that comes pre-installed on Windows 10 computers.</p><p>Navigate to the folder where your video file is located and right click on it. You will go to “open with” and then choose the Photos app. When it is open in the application, you can click on “Edit &amp; Create” and then go to “Add slo-mo”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/slow-motion-photos-app.jpg"                      alt="slow motion video microsoft photos"                ></p><p>If you do not see the option anywhere on your Photos app, there is a chance you are running an outdated version of Windows 10 on your computer. All you need to do is navigate to Windows Update through your system menu. When all the updates install, you will have the latest Photos app with this feature.</p><h2 id="Part-2：Customizing-the-Slow-Motion-Effect"><a href="#Part-2：Customizing-the-Slow-Motion-Effect" class="headerlink" title="Part 2：Customizing the Slow Motion Effect"></a>Part 2：Customizing the Slow Motion Effect</h2><p>When you are using the Photos app to add a slow motion effect to your videos, you can tweak it to your liking. You will be able to select the speed using a slider, which lets you get the precise slow motion effect that you desire.</p><p>There is also the handy option of being able to select the portion of your video where you want to add this effect. Say you are producing a longer video, where you want the effect in place for a few seconds.</p><p>Now you can select the beginning and end point using the bottom slider on the Photos app. Choose the precise starting and ending of the slow motion effect, and then watch through your video to ensure it is exactly as you want.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-slow-motion-microsoft-photos.jpg"                      alt="slow motion video microsoft photos"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983471">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983471.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983471">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983471.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983471%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983471/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>We recommend that you save your video file under a new name when you are done making your desired changes.
