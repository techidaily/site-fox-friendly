Now, by integrating Artificial Intelligent features, we can use any online photo background changer to instantly remove the existing background of our images (or replace it with a new one). From all the available options, I have listed some of the most perfect photo background changer tools that you can readily use.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: What’s the Need for Changing the Background in your Photos?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Top 10+ Online Photo Background Changers</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-What’s-the-Need-for-Changing-the-Background-in-your-Photos"><a href="#Part-1-What’s-the-Need-for-Changing-the-Background-in-your-Photos" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What’s the Need for Changing the Background in your Photos?"></a>Part 1: What’s the Need for Changing the Background in your Photos?</h2><p>Ideally, you can consider using an image background changer due to either of the following reasons:</p><ul><li>While clicking an image, there could be unwanted objects or too many people in the background.</li><li>You might have to completely remove the background of an image and use it for any other purpose.</li><li>Chances are that you might want to use your photo for a professional task, and its background could not be so appealing.</li><li>There could be any other creative reason for you to remove the background of a photo and apply any other layer instead.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Top-10-Online-Photo-Background-Changers"><a href="#Part-2-Top-10-Online-Photo-Background-Changers" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Top 10+ Online Photo Background Changers"></a>Part 2: Top 10+ Online Photo Background Changers</h2><p>If you are looking for a reliable online photo background changer tool, then you can consider exploring the following solutions:</p><h4 id="2-Remove-BG"><a href="#2-Remove-BG" class="headerlink" title="2. Remove BG"></a>2. Remove BG</h4><p>Remove BG is a perfect photo background changer tool that is extremely easy to use. Once the photo is uploaded, it will automatically detect human figures and will remove its background. You can then add any other background of your choice – texture, bold colors, customized images, and so on. If you want, you can freely download the image for 0.25 megapixels, but to download an HD image, you have to pay one credit per photo.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/online-photo-background-changer-removebg.jpg"                      alt="online photo background changer removebg"                ></p><h4 id="3-Adobe-Spark"><a href="#3-Adobe-Spark" class="headerlink" title="3. Adobe Spark"></a>3. Adobe Spark</h4><p>If you are looking for a hassle-free solution to change a photo’s background, then you can also try Adobe Spark. The online tool is powered by Adobe and will let you upload any JPG or PNG photos. Afterward, the application will remove the background of the image and will let you save it as a PNG file that you can overlap on any background of your choice.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/photo-background-changer-spark.jpg"                      alt="photo background changer spark"                ></p><h4 id="4-Wondershare-PixCut"><a href="#4-Wondershare-PixCut" class="headerlink" title="4. Wondershare PixCut"></a>4. Wondershare PixCut</h4><p>Developed by Wondershare, PixCut is a free online background changer tool that you can use on any browser. To use it, you just have to go to its official website and simply upload any photo. Now, the online tool would automatically remove the background of your photo with its smart AI features. Later, PixCut will let you save the file in the PNG format that you can edit on any application on your system or mobile.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/wondershare-pixcut.jpg"                      alt="wondershare pixcut"                ></p><h4 id="5-Slazzer-Photo-Background-Remover"><a href="#5-Slazzer-Photo-Background-Remover" class="headerlink" title="5. Slazzer Photo Background Remover"></a>5. Slazzer Photo Background Remover</h4><p>Slazzer has come up with a wide range of utility tools, including an online photo background changer. The tool supports PNG and JPG files and would let you automatically remove the background of an image. Its AI features can automatically detect all the popular figures like human faces, cars, trees, pets, and so on. However, using Slazzer, you can only remove the background of an image and would have to insert a new background on another tool.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/online-photo-background-changer-slazzer.jpg"                      alt="online photo background changer slazzer"                ></p><h4 id="6-Fotor-Photo-Background-Changer"><a href="#6-Fotor-Photo-Background-Changer" class="headerlink" title="6. Fotor Photo Background Changer"></a>6. Fotor Photo Background Changer</h4><p>Fotor offers a couple of online features related to photo editing and this one is another smart tool that you can use on its website. The image background changer is easy to use, can remove the background of any photo, and let you replace it with a new one. While it offers some of the most advanced features for online image editing, the application is not available for free (and would cost around $8.99 per month).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/online-photo-background-changer-fotor.jpg"                      alt="online photo background changer fotor"                ></p><h4 id="7-Clip-Magic-Photo-Background-Remover"><a href="#7-Clip-Magic-Photo-Background-Remover" class="headerlink" title="7. Clip Magic Photo Background Remover"></a>7. Clip Magic Photo Background Remover</h4><p>Clip Magic also offers a smart and quick solution to change the background of an image online. Once the photo is loaded to the online application, it will let you get rid of the background easily (without any technical hassle). Apart from that, you can also use its smart editor to make all kinds of minor changes to your photos easily.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/photo-background-changer-clip-magic.jpg"                      alt="photo background changer clip magic"                ></p><h4 id="8-Edit-Photos-for-Free-Background-Remover"><a href="#8-Edit-Photos-for-Free-Background-Remover" class="headerlink" title="8. Edit Photos for Free Background Remover"></a>8. Edit Photos for Free Background Remover</h4><p>As the name suggests, this is a freely available image editor that can also be used to change a photo’s background. Since it is an online tool, you can use it on any website without downloading anything on your system. Once the photo is manually uploaded, the application will automatically detect a figure (like a human face, car, or any other object). It will now crop the area of the figure and would remove its background, letting you change it later on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/photo-background-changer-edit-photos.jpg"                      alt="photo background changer edit photos"                ></p><h4 id="9-Foco-Clipping"><a href="#9-Foco-Clipping" class="headerlink" title="9. Foco Clipping"></a>9. Foco Clipping</h4><p>The next perfect photo background changer that I would recommend is from Foco Clipping. One of the best things about this online tool is that it can remove the background of multiple images at the same time. You can upload your photos in a bulk, let it process them, and remove their background. The image background changer is known for its exceptional results for cropping human figures with precise body and hair scaling.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/online-photo-background-changer-foco.jpg"                      alt="online photo background changer foco"                ></p><h4 id="10-PicsArt-Image-Background-Changer"><a href="#10-PicsArt-Image-Background-Changer" class="headerlink" title="10.PicsArt Image Background Changer"></a>10.PicsArt Image Background Changer</h4><p>The online photo background changer by PicsArt is quite easy to use and offers a wide range of features. You can upload your photos one by one and can manually edit them on its interface. The application can automatically remove the background of your image and would let you save it as a PNG file on your system (to be used offline with any other application).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/online-photo-background-changer-picsart.jpg"                      alt="online photo background changer picsart"                ></p><h4 id="11-Cut-Out-Pro-Photo-Background-Remover"><a href="#11-Cut-Out-Pro-Photo-Background-Remover" class="headerlink" title="11. Cut Out Pro Photo Background Remover"></a>11. Cut Out Pro Photo Background Remover</h4><p>Lastly, if you are looking for a free online background changer tool, then you can head to the website of Cut Out Pro. You can upload a photo from your computer’s storage or simply paste its URL. The application can automatically detect human figures, pets, cars, trees, designs, and several other objects. After removing the background, you can apply any other color, effect, or design as a background on its native interface as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/online-photo-background-changer-cutout.jpg"                      alt="online photo background changer cutout"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>I’m sure that after reading this post, you would be able to do a background change online of any photo of yours. To make it easier for you, I have listed both online background changer free and paid tools in this post. Since most of these tools are available for free, you can explore them on your own and simply recommend an ideal online photo background changer to others as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Ollie Mattison</p><p>Ollie Mattison is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Ollie Mattison</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-building-your-hyperlapse-filmmaking-toolkit-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Building Your Hyperlapse Filmmaking Toolkit for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-professional-stability-essentials-for-youtube-videographers-for-2024/"><u>[New] Professional Stability Essentials for YouTube Videographers for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/unpacking-the-sequencing-of-a-20mb-file/"><u>Unpacking the Sequencing of a 20MB File</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-from-two-dimensions-to-three-making-text-pop-in-photoshop/"><u>[New] From Two-Dimensions to Three  Making Text Pop in Photoshop</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/discovery-at-work-a-one-man-review-on-3dr-printers-for-2024/"><u>Discovery at Work  A One-Man Review on '3DR' Printers for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/2024-approved-how-to-overcome-sony-a6400-video-viewing-failure/"><u>2024 Approved  How to Overcome Sony A6400 Video Viewing Failure</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-revolutionary-viewfinder-unstoppable-video-meet-the-xs-100i/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Revolutionary Viewfinder, Unstoppable Video - Meet the XS 100I</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-inside-out-the-100-complete-theta-s-study/"><u>[New] Inside Out  The 100%% Complete Theta S Study</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-data-from-iphone-6-plus-to-others-devices-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-data-from-ios-transfer-data-from-ios/"><u>How To Transfer Data From iPhone 6 Plus To Others devices? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-transfer.techidaily.com/various-methods-to-transfer-pictures-from-apple-iphone-13-mini-to-pc-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-ios/"><u>Various Methods to Transfer Pictures from Apple iPhone 13 mini to PC | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-transfer-music-from-tecno-camon-20-premier-5g-to-ipod-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Transfer Music from Tecno Camon 20 Premier 5G to iPod | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-optimizing.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-audio-visual-synergy-incorporate-free-soundtracks-into-photos/"><u>New 2024 Approved Audio-Visual Synergy Incorporate Free Soundtracks Into Photos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-top-10-alternatives-to-game-bar-for-screenshots-and-recordings/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Top 10 Alternatives to Game Bar for Screenshots & Recordings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-voice-clone.techidaily.com/updated-update-6-best-voice-changers-you-cant-miss/"><u>Updated Update 6 Best Voice Changers You Cant Miss</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-unleash-your-potential-detailed-guide-for-ps4-recordings-with-obs/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Unleash Your Potential  Detailed Guide for PS4 Recordings with OBS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-come-up-with-the-best-pokemon-team-on-oneplus-nord-3-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Come up With the Best Pokemon Team On OnePlus Nord 3 5G? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/guide-deleting-items-from-your-youtubeumbers-list/"><u>Guide  Deleting Items From Your YouTube'umbers List</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Below are complete details:</p><h2 id="Part-2-Pros-and-Cons"><a href="#Part-2-Pros-and-Cons" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Pros and Cons"></a>Part 2 Pros and Cons</h2><table><thead><tr><th><strong>-</strong></th><th><strong>Samsung Gear 360</strong></th><th><strong>LG 360 Cam</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Pros</td><td>Consumer 360 camera with Highest resolution</td><td>Price range is low as compared to its competitor</td></tr><tr><td>Easy to use and Self-contained</td><td>Easy to operate and hold</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Dust resistant and Splashproof</td><td>More Memory capacity</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Battery and microSD card are Replaceable</td><td>Compatible with iOS and Android</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>MicroSDslot can extend support up to maximum 128GB cards</td><td>It is possible to shoot using only one lens when you have to capture non 360 degree images</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Loop recording, Time-Lapse recording, 360° spherical capture</td><td>Audio quality is much better than competitor</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Wireless Integration</td><td>-</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Cons</td><td>Big size so you cannot keep it in pocket</td><td>For uploading your videos to facebook and YouTube, you may need desktop application.</td></tr><tr><td>Its designs is not waterproof</td><td>Even the desktop app do not provide any editing option to captured images</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>You need to connect it with latest Samsung phone</td><td>There are some Software glitches</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Stitch lines appear to be very apparent</td><td>Battery do not come with swappable feature</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>It poses some limitations on video and photo sharing abilities</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>Not water-resistant</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>Doesn’t serve with internal storage space</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="Part-3-Image-quality-comparison"><a href="#Part-3-Image-quality-comparison" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Image quality comparison"></a>Part 3 Image quality comparison</h2><p>When we watch 360 videos on tablet or smartphone then it leads to immersive experience; a facility of VR headset can add more features to your 360 video world. In case of Gear 360 you will be able to enjoy 4K resolution whereas LG 360 serves with 2K resolution only thus <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Samsung Gear 360 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> will be better choice in this case. On the other side if we talk about audio abilities then LG360 has an edge over Samsung Gear 360 because of its ability to record 5.1 level surround sounds that is major requirement of a 360 degree video. The Gear 360 possess stereo record feature that can capture voice only in two directions thus resultant audio in scenes is not that much clear. Moving forward to more technical specifications, the bit rate – well known as quality of image with resolution is 60MB&#x2F;second in case of Gear 360 whereas LG360 cam limits up to 19MB&#x2F;second, this makes a big difference in quality. If we count features then Samsung gear 360 definitely have more features as like its waterproof body, highly stabilized video results and F2.0 dual lenses but LG360 lacks behind in these features.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Editing-software-comparison-comparison"><a href="#Part-4-Editing-software-comparison-comparison" class="headerlink" title="Part 4 Editing software comparison comparison"></a>Part 4 Editing software comparison comparison</h2><p>It is possible to stitch videos as well as photographs taken from the 360 degree camera using Galaxy phone and they can be directly shared on social media. Some consumers also love to use Desktop software to edit the camera results in detail. Same as like Gear 360, the latest device from LG can also capture good quality 360 degree videos as well as photographs but it do not support spherical share as like Samsung unit. You can pair up LG360 cam only with LG G5 latest smartphone whereas video and photo editing options are not yet known for smartphone as well as PC. Both these devices come with Wi-Fi connectivity, USB port and Bluetooth capabilities whereas in case of Samsung 360 gear NFC is an additional option. The ultimate combination of time lapse recording, 360 spherical recording and loop recording makes everything easy in Samsung gear where you can avail wonderful results for each real time recording.</p><p>Check this side-by-side video review to know more about this two 360 degree cameras:</p><h2 id="Part-5-Conclusion"><a href="#Part-5-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Part 5 Conclusion"></a>Part 5 Conclusion</h2><p>Price difference of both devices is well reflected in the comparison table above and you got enough information about their features too. The gear 360 results better looking images along with better color distributions but in case of LG the image as well as video quality is comparatively degraded; Although, LG cam is much faster and discrete design but for professional photographers it will not result better output. The two additional shooting modes of Gear 360 also allows better quality of videos and its compatibility with Samsung smartphones allows easy editing and uploading. After getting real time users recommendations and their reviews, users are advised to prefer Samsung GEAR 360 for their Virtual Reality needs but those who cannot compromise for price range can go for LG360 device as its audio quality is much better than Samsung gear 360 along with ability to connect with Android as well as iOS devices.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Benjamin Arango</p><p>Benjamin Arango is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Benjamin Arango</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/in-2024-utilizing-b-roll-to-enrich-narrative-arcs/"><u>In 2024, Utilizing B-Roll to Enrich Narrative Arcs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-top-5-ios-applications-bringing-your-podcast-to-life-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Top 5 iOS Applications Bringing Your Podcast to Life for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-full-review-utilizing-googles-voice-recognition-in-word-processing/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Full Review  Utilizing Google's Voice Recognition in Word Processing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-a-deep-dive-into-panasonics-hx-a1-camera-features/"><u>[Updated] A Deep Dive Into Panasonic's HX-A1 Camera Features</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-revealing-historys-best-anime-openers-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Revealing History's Best Anime Openers for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-inside-the-scoring-of-toolwizs-photography-software/"><u>[Updated] Inside the Scoring of Toolwiz's Photography Software</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-masters-choice-10-leading-photo-backdrop-swap-tools/"><u>[New] Master's Choice  10 Leading Photo Backdrop Swap Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/top-10-fixes-for-phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wi-fi-on-lava-yuva-3-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Top 10 Fixes for Phone Keep Disconnecting from Wi-Fi On Lava Yuva 3 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/master-iphone-filmmaking-for-full-sphere-effects-for-2024/"><u>Master iPhone Filmmaking for Full Sphere Effects for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-exploring-the-creme-de-la-creme-of-android-mobas-10/"><u>[New] In 2024, Exploring the Crème De La Crème of Android MOBAs (#10)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/how-to-change-your-oppo-f23-5g-location-on-twitter-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Change your Oppo F23 5G Location on Twitter | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-maximizing-your-videos-impact-with-expertly-recorded-voices/"><u>[New] Maximizing Your Video's Impact with Expertly Recorded Voices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://voice-adjusting.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-ultimate-selection-of-windows-10-audio-mixing-tools/"><u>2024 Approved The Ultimate Selection of Windows 10 Audio Mixing Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://apple-account.techidaily.com/in-2024-apple-id-is-greyed-out-from-iphone-8-plus-how-to-bypass-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, Apple ID is Greyed Out From iPhone 8 Plus How to Bypass?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/new-keep-up-the-pace-in-snapchat-streaks-with-these-tips-for-2024/"><u>[New] Keep Up the Pace in Snapchat Streaks with These Tips for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Various image attributes such as contrast, color, saturation, detail, black level, and white point can be enhanced whether it is movies, videos, or still images.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-color-grading"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-color-grading" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What is color grading?"></a>Part 1. What is color grading?</h2><p>Color grading is the process of stylizing the color scheme of your footage by “painting” over what you’ve created using color correction. After the colorist completes the color correction, they can begin the process of grading the footage. During color grading, colorists use editing software to stylize the shot – emphasizing the visual tone and atmosphere of the film and making it look more cinematic.</p><p>Color sorting can be used for both technical and creative changes. Colorists use color gradation for artistic purposes to ensure that a film’s carefully selected color palette conveys a specific atmosphere, style, or emotion. For example, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0169547/"><em>American Beauty (1999)</em></a> uses redder in dramatic moments to represent passion, anger, and power, whereas <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1587310/"><em>Maleficent (2014)</em></a> uses green to represent danger, corruption, and darkness.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/color-grading-tutorial-1.jpg"                      alt="color grading tutorial"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-11-best-Color-Correction-and-Color-Grading-Tutorial"><a href="#Part-2-11-best-Color-Correction-and-Color-Grading-Tutorial" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 11 best Color Correction and Color Grading Tutorial"></a>Part 2. 11 best Color Correction and Color Grading Tutorial</h2><h3 id="1-Color-correction-and-grading-in-Premiere-Pro-2021"><a href="#1-Color-correction-and-grading-in-Premiere-Pro-2021" class="headerlink" title="1.

However, you will see pixelated imagery when you zoom in, making it look rougher and lousy. That is a significant issue when dealing with graphical artwork or logos- a clear and crisp look is essential.</p><p>This is where <strong>vector images</strong> come in handy, a type of graphical image format that utilizes points, curves, and lines instead of a group of pixels to form the image structure. That works better for digital logos and graphic art, although slightly complex to edit.</p><p>If you want to find free <strong>vector stock images</strong>, several websites offer a rich library of these options, including other functions like editing vector images. Here is a list of the best ones you should consider seriously.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/best-10-websites-for-premium-quality-vector-stock-images-in-2022-1.jpg"                      alt="vector image example from vecteezy"                ></p><h2 id="Part-I-10-Top-Websites-with-Free-Stock-Vector-Images"><a href="#Part-I-10-Top-Websites-with-Free-Stock-Vector-Images" class="headerlink" title="Part I. 10 Top Websites with Free Stock Vector Images"></a>Part I. 10 Top Websites with Free Stock Vector Images</h2><p>Multiple <strong>free vectors websites</strong> are currently active.

Is it worth buying a camcorder?"></a>1. Is it worth buying a camcorder?</h3><p>One of the biggest reasons for buying camcorders is the lens. With DSLRs and mirrorless cameras coming to the forefront, people doubt the credibility of a camcorder. But camcorders have powerful and long zoom lenses with tiny imaging sensors, which makes it more powerful than any DSLR. It also comes with variable speed zoom control that can create smooth, slow zooms to reveal and introduce a location, or quick punch-ins to highlight the action. There are no limits in recording time with camcorders, which makes it ideal for event photography. Camcorders can be plugged into the socket to continue with videography when batteries are exhausted and have dedicated dials for adjusting volume levels. Therefore, camcorders are a better and worthy purchase.</p><h3 id="2-What-camcorder-do-YouTubers-use"><a href="#2-What-camcorder-do-YouTubers-use" class="headerlink" title="2.

For professional and advanced level, the manual controls of GoPro can become a big problem.

It really doesn’t matter what kind of use you put a camera – creative shots, hands-free convenience, or stationary surveillance. For shots that require slow motion, time-lapses, or simply capturing movement, handling tripods are way too much hassle. And when the times (and shots) are too rocky, they’re just not enough to stabilize and focus.</p><p>For times when you’re on a tight budget or with no room for extra equipment, or if you simply aren’t well versed with complex camera functions but love to shoot, the auto-track camera gives way to your creativity to shine.</p><ol><li><strong>What Is The Price Of A Tracking Camera?</strong></li></ol><p>The price of an auto track camera can widely vary according to the features, quality, brand, and additional accessories that you are looking for. On the lower end, you can get a face-tracking camera for $400. At this low price, you may get a decent camera that auto tracks, but it may also mean a compromise on durability, sensor precision, resolution, and quality, among other things.</p><p>On the higher end, with loaded features, high resolution, flexibility in lenses, sound audio recording, you can expect the price to range between one to a few grand easily.</p><ol><li><strong>Where To Buy An Auto Tracking Camera For Sports?</strong></li></ol><p>It is easy to purchase an auto-tracking camera for sports, thanks to the convenience of online shopping. You can find most of these cameras on sites like Amazon at the standard price set by the manufacturer. Also, there is the official company’s e-commerce page and more affiliate blogs and vendors that you can shop from.

The entire idea of the podcast is auto-based information and shows to entertain users while doing something tedious and tiresome.</p><p>It allows you to fill those moments by learning new things and improving cognitive skills. Plus, it is a side-effect of doing things like driving, walking the dog, and commuting to work. Basically, all these tasks should meet all these or one of these criteria:</p><h3 id="●-No-need-to-use-your-brain"><a href="#●-No-need-to-use-your-brain" class="headerlink" title="● No need to use your brain"></a>● No need to use your brain</h3><p>Tasks like commuting, taking a bath, or doing dishes are subconscious. Yes, you can make them mindful and also make their meditative process. But if you are still bored, it is best to fill these little moments of your day with information-rich podcasts. Any mindless task is an opportunity. You do not need to devote any attention to these tasks and can listen to podcasts during this time.</p><h3 id="●-Thing-is-able-to-do-independently"><a href="#●-Thing-is-able-to-do-independently" class="headerlink" title="● Thing is able to do independently"></a>● Thing is able to do independently</h3><p>Collaborative work involves communicating with others. So, it is usually best to listen to the podcast when doing something independently. But this does not mean you should always listen to the podcast when doing independent work only. Even if you are surrounded by others and working on something independently, then you can fill the time with the podcast.</p><p>Moreover, some things like when you are driving with someone or you are on a road trip, and the other person also enjoys listening to the podcast, then you can fill the time with podcast episodes that interest you both. This also allows you to talk about the episodes and the ideas discussed there, and you both will have something to talk about.</p><h3 id="●-Repetitive"><a href="#●-Repetitive" class="headerlink" title="● Repetitive"></a>● Repetitive</h3><p>You can tune in to the podcasts for repetitive tasks like doing the dishes, gardening, etc. The idea is to complement the repetitive task with something useful.</p><h2 id="15-Things-To-Do-While-Listening-To-Podcasts"><a href="#15-Things-To-Do-While-Listening-To-Podcasts" class="headerlink" title="15 Things To Do While Listening To Podcasts"></a>15 Things To Do While Listening To Podcasts</h2><p>That said, here’s a short list of things to do while listening to a podcast. It is important to note that not all of you might be doing these tasks, but you must be doing something along these lines. So, it is all about familiarizing you with mindless tasks and how you can make the most of that activity by complementing it with a podcast episode.</p><h3 id="1-Yoga-or-stretch"><a href="#1-Yoga-or-stretch" class="headerlink" title="1. Yoga or stretch"></a>1. Yoga or stretch</h3><p>As surprising as this might sound, listening to a podcast during Yoga or stretch is a great way to spice things up. Although most folks might prefer to combine yoga or gym with music, you can still listen to an information-packed yoga Podcast.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-2.jpg"                      alt="yoga podcast"                ></p><p>Besides, once you learn the stretch or yoga positions, it becomes a subconscious process. So, chances are, you might not need music to do the stretches or exercises you’ve already learned. Overall, a good yoga podcast will help improve your knowledge of the yoga field!</p><h3 id="2-Jogging"><a href="#2-Jogging" class="headerlink" title="2. Jogging"></a>2. Jogging</h3><p>Jogging appeals for its mindlessness is prominent among people. Just one foot in front of the other is all jogging and running demands. Again, most people listen to music while on a jog or run. However, you can switch from music to your favorite podcasts easily.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-3.jpg"                      alt="jogging podcast"                ></p><p>Listening to podcasts is a mindful activity, so when you run or jog with a podcast episode playing in your ears, it is easy to get distracted. So, it is vital to jog or run in a safe environment while listening to podcasts.</p><h3 id="3-Fishing"><a href="#3-Fishing" class="headerlink" title="3. Fishing"></a>3. Fishing</h3><p>Many people think about an activity that involves catching fish. However, catching fish is just part of fishing. In reality, it is the moments you share with your family, see new things, and experience new challenges, and that is what fishing is all about.</p><p>If you go fishing often and listen to music or sit with your friends, you can instead listen to a podcast episode this time and create a different experience for everyone in the group.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-4.jpg"                      alt="fishing podcast"                ></p><p>Moreover, listening to a podcast while fishing does not mean you should start the podcast only when you sit near the lake or pond to fish. It is the entire process; you can start your podcast episodes right from when you take your car, the breaks you take, and while returning too. Try this one when you go fishing and dedicate all the time you set for fishing to listening to podcasts.</p><h3 id="4-Organize-your-photos-or-files"><a href="#4-Organize-your-photos-or-files" class="headerlink" title="4. Organize your photos or files"></a>4. Organize your photos or files</h3><p>If you often take time to organize your photos or files, you can combine that process with listening to your favorite podcasts. As mentioned, listening to a podcast is about concentrating on it and understanding the ideas discussed. So, you can do that with any mindless activities.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-5.jpg"                      alt="organizing podcast"                ></p><p>The benefit of combining listening to a podcast while organizing your photos or files is that you can learn new things and simplify your life by organizing your folders filled with countless images and files you always want to manage. It is to be noted that you can also listen to podcast episodes while managing your mail, scrolling through social media pages, or editing photos.</p><h3 id="5-Cook-a-meal"><a href="#5-Cook-a-meal" class="headerlink" title="5. Cook a meal"></a>5. Cook a meal</h3><p>Do you cook daily? Or maybe once or twice a week? Well, you can tune into your favorite episodes and cook. The best thing is if you are interested in cooking podcasts, then it is a perfect combination. Nevertheless, even if you follow podcasts discussing astronomy or rocket science, cooking is one of the best things to do while listening to podcasts, it saves time, and you also enjoy a healthy and delicious meal.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-6.jpg"                      alt="cooking podcast"                ></p><p>Chopping vegetables or meat, the washing process, and food preparation are some activities that consume a lot of time of people, so filling this with information-rich podcasts is a good substitute for your time.</p><h3 id="6-Driving"><a href="#6-Driving" class="headerlink" title="6. Driving"></a>6. Driving</h3><p>Driving to work and from work takes a lot of time, and you often get tired of being in the car. It is best to substitute this time with your favorite podcasts daily. This way, you will be able to make the most of the time that you waste daily.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-7.jpg"                      alt="drive podcast"                ></p><p>It is important to retain that information-filled podcasts often grab all your attention, so you might focus on something other than driving itself. So, ensure that you know your routes well and listen to causal podcasts you can divert from while driving on the roads. It is best to listen to podcasts with a friend or colleague, as podcasts at such times create a perfect ebb and flow throughout the drive.</p><h3 id="7-Do-laundry-or-Fold-laundry"><a href="#7-Do-laundry-or-Fold-laundry" class="headerlink" title="7. Do laundry or Fold laundry"></a>7. Do laundry or Fold laundry</h3><p>Laundry can be frustrating; it is a hurtful process that even a laundry enthusiast hates to do. It’s time-consuming, unceasing, and seems like a never-ending process you do not want to engage in.</p><p>However, podcasts are made for such times and hurtful tasks like doing laundry or folding laundry. You can grab your headphones and tune in to your favorite podcast episode, making doing laundry an information-filled session and more effective.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-8.jpg"                      alt="laundry podcast"                ></p><p>Better yet, swift to hand-laundering. Hand laundering has a bad rep, but it is one of the best ways to burn some calories. Sometimes, hand-laundering is necessary; for instance, if you have to wash an expensive garment or want to avoid going to the laundromat, combine the entire process with your favorite podcast playing in your ears.</p><h3 id="8-Gardening"><a href="#8-Gardening" class="headerlink" title="8. Gardening"></a>8. Gardening</h3><p>Gardening is a set of activities that often are mindless. Additionally, this is one of those activities you often have to turn to every week to ensure your plants are growing normally. You can perfectly fill these activities by tuning a podcast and making the most of your time.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-9.jpg"                      alt="gardening podcast"                ></p><p>Basically, if you are thinking about all the stuff to do while listening to podcasts, compile a list of mindless activities you regularly engage in and see if you can substitute such activities; in this case, gardening with podcasts should feel comfortable to you.</p><p>For instance, if you cannot focus on both, then it is best not to chase two rabbits simultaneously. The process only works if you can combine both tasks without compromising on one.</p><h3 id="9-Walk-the-dog"><a href="#9-Walk-the-dog" class="headerlink" title="9. Walk the dog"></a>9. Walk the dog</h3><p>Walking the dog is a meditative process. It’s about appreciating the surroundings, reconnecting with nature, and bonding with our four-legged friend while roaming the city’s surroundings.</p><p>However, listening to podcasts while walking your dog can also be a new experience. Not only can you listen to your podcasts, but if you choose the right one, you will cry and laugh as you walk the dog.</p><p>Besides, podcasts are one of the most followed things by dog-loving communities. A lot of people have the habit of tuning in to their favorite podcasts while walking their dogs, and you can be one of them.</p><h3 id="10-Do-the-Dishes"><a href="#10-Do-the-Dishes" class="headerlink" title="10. Do the Dishes"></a>10. Do the Dishes</h3><p>If we have to inform this, it means you are not having fun while doing the dishes. Doing dishes is one of the chores which you should take as a challenge and make really fun. The fun could be of different types, like timing yourself or racing with someone else. In this case, you can play your favorite podcast episodes and listen to them daily while doing the dishes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-10.jpg"                      alt="dishes podcast"                ></p><p>The fun, the learning, and the sense of doing something different hits differently when you combine podcasts with doing dishes; not to forget, you made something of the time that you hate the most of your day.</p><h3 id="11-Paint-your-nails"><a href="#11-Paint-your-nails" class="headerlink" title="11. Paint your nails"></a>11. Paint your nails</h3><p>Painting nails is once again one of those processes that are initially elegant and important for girls. However, the waiting time while you are drying out the nail polish is the worst. However, doing something fun like playing your high-beat music with dancing as you’ve never danced before takes you into an astral world and allows you to experience a different side of yourself. This time, however, try playing the newest episode from your favorite podcast. And note down your experience once you complete it.</p><h3 id="12-Take-a-bath"><a href="#12-Take-a-bath" class="headerlink" title="12. Take a bath"></a>12. Take a bath</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-11.jpg"                      alt="taking a bath podcast"                ></p><p>Many people take baths for granted. It is one of the best ways to reset, relax, and recharge yourself after a tiresome day. You should always make your bathes meditative or go really far into a spiritual process.</p><p>Try this: set the right temperature of the water, add essential oils to the bathtub, light some candles, and play your favorite podcast. Believe me, soon, taking a bath while listening to a podcast will become one of the best moments of your day.</p><h3 id="13-Commute"><a href="#13-Commute" class="headerlink" title="13. Commute"></a>13. Commute</h3><p>Daily commutes occupy a large part of everyone’s day. Yes, the work from home is becoming a reality. But that reality is still far in the future. Until then, you have to commute to work, children to school, groceries, and so on. Well, you can fill these times with information-rich podcasts and learn new things.</p><p>It sounds like you might not focus and listen to the podcast like you would at home. But you’ll be amazed at how well you can adapt podcast listening while commuting in a bus or train filled with people.</p><h3 id="14-Clean-the-house"><a href="#14-Clean-the-house" class="headerlink" title="14. Clean the house"></a>14. Clean the house</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-12.jpg"                      alt="clean the house podcast"                ></p><p>Again, it all comes down to making a daunting task like cleaning the house fun and entertaining. If you truly enjoy listening to the podcast, play it on your home theatre and listen to the episodes as you clean your house.</p><p>Most people ignore these beautiful tasks of the day, thinking they will be wasting their time, and often hire a housemaid. But that’s the beauty of the modern world; you can make these tasks fun and entertaining if only complemented with the right podcasts or music.</p><h3 id="15-Haircut-or-hair-dye"><a href="#15-Haircut-or-hair-dye" class="headerlink" title="15. Haircut or hair dye"></a>15. Haircut or hair dye</h3><p>A haircut is a time that you give to your barber. It is all about sitting on the chair and letting the masters do their work. And putting on earphones for listening to music and podcast can be disastrous, as one snip and your costly earphones will be gone for good.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-13.jpg"                      alt="haircut podcast"                ></p><p>However, you can make the time of everyone sitting at the saloon beautiful by simply asking the barber to play one of the podcasts they like or you like. This will also allow you to experience new podcasts you aren’t familiar with and initiate a good conversation with your client.</p><h2 id="Summing-up"><a href="#Summing-up" class="headerlink" title="Summing up"></a>Summing up</h2><p>The above list of things to do while listening to podcasts is all about acquainting you with tedious tasks and making them beautiful.</p><p>As mentioned, you can complement a podcast episode with any boring task you have to do daily and make your time most effective and fun.</p><p>Overall, there are too many mindless things that you have to do daily; simply remember to carry your earphones and make that mindless activity into a beautiful, fun, and informative session.</p><p>Using podcasts to learn and entertain is a great idea. Multitasking is also possible, which is convenient for people with little free time.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-1.jpg"                      alt="podcast live"                ></p><p>So, to make the most of your time spent listening to podcasts, here are some ideas on what you can do while listening!

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Abbreviated-Action-Sequences-Script"><a href="#Abbreviated-Action-Sequences-Script" class="headerlink" title="Abbreviated Action Sequences Script"></a>Abbreviated Action Sequences Script</h2><p>Short films are becoming more and more popular with seasoned filmmakers, breakout filmmakers, and students alike. Search on YouTube and you’ll find thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of short film examples. But what makes for a good short <a class="link"   href="https://blog.celtx.com/write-the-script-5-basic-steps/" >film script <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>? How can you make it stand out from the crowd?</p><p>Today, we look at seven important aspects of a great short film script and how you can improve yours. Can you put these into practice when writing your next script?</p><h2 id="Part-1-7-tips-for-improving-short-film-scripts"><a href="#Part-1-7-tips-for-improving-short-film-scripts" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. 7 tips for improving short film scripts"></a>Part 1. 7 tips for improving short film scripts</h2><p>There’s never been a better time to learn the craft of writing short film scripts. Interest and access to creating and viewing short films and series episodes have exploded worldwide, both on television and on the web. A great short film can also open doors for you into the film industry, as Barry Jenkins discovered with his great screenplay for the short film My Josephine, which I wrote in my screenwriting class at Florida State University.</p><p>But writing a successful short script is not easy. It requires the craft and concentration of a medieval artist carving scenes into walnut. So here are seven tips for creating a short script.</p><h3 id="1-Storyline"><a href="#1-Storyline" class="headerlink" title="1. Storyline"></a>1. Storyline</h3><p>This is always, always, the number one problem for my screenwriting students. They come up with big story ideas, often feature screenplay ideas, but quickly find that their idea doesn’t fit or work in short form. The result is what I call “narrative cramming.” The story can’t breathe. So, you need an idea that is small, specific, and significant to your main character.</p><p><strong><em>My Josephine</em></strong> was inspired by “an image of two people’s legs hanging over a table in my head,” according to Barry Jenkins. I saw them, young and intimate, working the night shift in a 24-hour laundry.” Even with this small, simple, and significant image as a starting point for a short script, Barry struggled to find a story in six pages that he could tell well. He attempted to include the murder in the Laundromat at one point, which resulted in, yes, narrative cramming. Barry rewrote the script a year later and “made it as simple as I could as a writer,” he told me. I was so moved by his transcript that I only wrote three words in the script – “Beautiful and gentle”. Just like his beautiful film.</p><h3 id="2-Characterization"><a href="#2-Characterization" class="headerlink" title="2. Characterization"></a>2. Characterization</h3><p>Writing compelling short scripts requires what Thornton Wilder called “shortcuts to the imagination.” And knowing what your main character wants in your story is the most important shortcut to understanding and discovering who your main character is. So, give your main character a desire or yearning for something that matters deeply to her. Then let your story flow from your character’s efforts to achieve that wish. The best stories, short or long, are about the human heart.</p><h3 id="3-An-independent-story"><a href="#3-An-independent-story" class="headerlink" title="3. An independent story"></a>3. An independent story</h3><p>It’s also a useful way to think of the script as an energy system, as William Gibson brilliantly says in Shakespeare’s play. An energy system begins with an Inciting Incident - a significant event&#x2F;discovery that unleashes the energy system - and ends with a Climax - the moment when the story’s outcome is known, and the energy system ends. Given the limited number of pages available in your short script, it’s essential that your inciting incident appears on the first page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/short-film-script-example-1.jpg"                      alt="an independent story"                ></p><h3 id="4-Conflict"><a href="#4-Conflict" class="headerlink" title="4. Conflict"></a>4. Conflict</h3><p>Conflict is every point of opposition between two forces (physical or intellectual), as well as the consequences of this opposition - all in full view of what can be seen on the screen, whether through cinema, television, or devices.</p><p>Screenwriters can’t convey conflict with background and inner thoughts or explanations of inner thoughts—that’s literary conflict.</p><p>Instead, screenwriters are tasked with presenting the conflict on screen through scene descriptions, character actions and reactions, and dialogue. While the dialogue is something we hear and could certainly—in smaller print—be used to replace literary prose to describe background information, backstory, and inner thoughts, the best screenplays and movies show rather than tell.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/short-film-script-example-2.jpg"                      alt="conflict"                ></p><h3 id="5-Turning-Point"><a href="#5-Turning-Point" class="headerlink" title="5. Turning Point"></a>5. Turning Point</h3><p>It’s helpful to think of a screenplay as a pattern of significant human change that you create at specific moments of change—the discoveries and decisions your main character makes that change the character and move the story forward. What your character wants and is trying to achieve in your short is the surface action – the events we see on screen. And how these events forever change a character’s inner landscape is deep action—your character arc.</p><p>If you want to see a well-crafted surface and deep action&#x2F;character arc in a fifteen-page script, read Chapter 17 <em>“Killer Kart”</em> in the book Making Short Scripts That Connect 5e, and screen the movie on the book’s website. It’s no surprise that the film is the most screened film ever made at the FSU Film School.</p><h3 id="6-Sublimation"><a href="#6-Sublimation" class="headerlink" title="6. Sublimation"></a>6. Sublimation</h3><p>Scenes are the <strong>“church of drama”</strong>, as William Gibson also brilliantly says. So, it’s helpful to think of your scenes as the time and place where a significant moment of change will occur, throwing your script into the next scene and moving your story forward. That is your purpose when you write a scene, to dramatize the moment (or moments) of change. That’s what matters. I like to think of a scene as an oyster and a moment of change as a pearl. Then cut to your scenes as close to the moment of change as possible and exit as soon as possible.</p><p>I got it, really got it, as a young playwright when the Actors Theater of Louisville commissioned me to write a ten-minute play. And I did—in six scenes that I hit late and left early, each with a small but significant moment of change that moved the story into the next scene. “A tender and effortless glissando that gracefully stretches from moment to wistful moment,” as The Los Angeles Times put it in my all-time favorite review.</p><h3 id="7-Ending"><a href="#7-Ending" class="headerlink" title="7.

Because of the magnitude of its importance, many writers struggle to close their scripts with the right resolution. But don’t worry, we’ll show you everything you need to know about how to end a storyboard with examples of basic storyboard formats from Star Wars: <strong><em>The Force Awakens</em></strong> and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1596363/"><strong><em>The Big Short</em></strong></a>.

It might seem like a daunting task, but it’s well worth doing.

Nothing has the same feeling as seeing your words come to life on screen<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"                      alt="Free Download"                >For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For macOS 10.14 or later</p><h3 id="2-Characterization-1"><a href="#2-Characterization-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Characterization"></a>2. Characterization</h3><p>Writing compelling short scripts requires what Thornton Wilder called “shortcuts to the imagination.” And knowing what your main character wants in your story is the most important shortcut to understanding and discovering who your main character is. So, give your main character a desire or yearning for something that matters deeply to her. Then let your story flow from your character’s efforts to achieve that wish. The best stories, short or long, are about the human heart.</p><h3 id="3-An-independent-story-1"><a href="#3-An-independent-story-1" class="headerlink" title="3. An independent story"></a>3. An independent story</h3><p>It’s also a useful way to think of the script as an energy system, as William Gibson brilliantly says in Shakespeare’s play. An energy system begins with an Inciting Incident - a significant event&#x2F;discovery that unleashes the energy system - and ends with a Climax - the moment when the story’s outcome is known, and the energy system ends. Given the limited number of pages available in your short script, it’s essential that your inciting incident appears on the first page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/short-film-script-example-1.jpg"                      alt="an independent story"                ></p><h3 id="4-Conflict-1"><a href="#4-Conflict-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Conflict"></a>4. Conflict</h3><p>Conflict is every point of opposition between two forces (physical or intellectual), as well as the consequences of this opposition - all in full view of what can be seen on the screen, whether through cinema, television, or devices.</p><p>Screenwriters can’t convey conflict with background and inner thoughts or explanations of inner thoughts—that’s literary conflict.</p><p>Instead, screenwriters are tasked with presenting the conflict on screen through scene descriptions, character actions and reactions, and dialogue. While the dialogue is something we hear and could certainly—in smaller print—be used to replace literary prose to describe background information, backstory, and inner thoughts, the best screenplays and movies show rather than tell.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/short-film-script-example-2.jpg"                      alt="conflict"                ></p><h3 id="5-Turning-Point-1"><a href="#5-Turning-Point-1" class="headerlink" title="5.

What your character wants and is trying to achieve in your short is the surface action – the events we see on screen. And how these events forever change a character’s inner landscape is deep action—your character arc.</p><p>If you want to see a well-crafted surface and deep action&#x2F;character arc in a fifteen-page script, read Chapter 17 <em>“Killer Kart”</em> in the book Making Short Scripts That Connect 5e, and screen the movie on the book’s website.

In case the previous century was considered to be the age of mass production and the growth of the internet, the 21th century will be known for the development and expansion of the virtual world.

The only difference between this and the actual thing is the real Metaverse is not going to be limited to one game, app, virtual world, or company. It is going to connect them all.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Can-You-Do-in-the-Metaverse-3"><a href="#Part-2-What-Can-You-Do-in-the-Metaverse-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Can You Do in the Metaverse?"></a>Part 2: What Can You Do in the Metaverse?</h2><p>Here are some great examples of the Metaverse.</p><h3 id="1-Ready-Player-One-3"><a href="#1-Ready-Player-One-3" class="headerlink" title="1.

In the list of awesome top Blu-Ray players, Sony BDP-S3700 has proven its edge with all impressive features. If you are searching for a player that can offer high standard performance even at reasonable price range then S3700 is recommended for you.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>It offers excellent picture quality.</li><li>Classic subtle contrast.</li><li>Highly stable and smooth motion.</li><li>Solid upscaler.</li><li>Comes with built in Wi-Fi capability.</li><li>Supports up conversion for 1080p so that it can work upon DVDs.</li><li>3D ready and compatible with 4K Ultra HD content.</li><li>Interactive interface for external world connectivity.</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>Sound quality is little disappointing.</li><li>Slow load time is a big trouble.</li></ul><h2 id="Features"><a href="#Features" class="headerlink" title="Features"></a>Features</h2><p> When we talk about features then S3700 offers impressive details that can satisfy most of the user needs. At back side of this device you will find an Ethernet port, HDMI output and one coaxial output that assist in making direct connections with external sound systems. At front side of device, you will find a USB port that allows easy connectivity to memory sticks and other similar kind of devices.</p><p> Moving towards the streaming capabilities, you will again find this device useful enough as it allows direct connectivity with Demand 5, YouTube, BBC iPlayer, Amazon Video and Netflix. If you are a dedicated towards PlayStation video usage then it is possible to get compatible app installed directly on your box.</p><p> One more interesting news is here for you as this device allows users to mirror their smartphone screen to TV directly using Miracast function of player. Thus it becomes much easier to control video as well as music from Android device. Now as this function is not present in other competitors like LG and Panasonic so Sony has an edge over them. If you want to fine tune your image then video noise reduction settings can be applied directly from ‘Mosquito Noise’ feature, it works on edges. Those who want to control noise on broadband range are advised to use ‘Mosaic- like block noise’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/S3700-2.jpg"                                     ></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01AT6B0DK/ref=as%5Fli%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&tag=vs-flora-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01AT6B0DK&linkId=a73a1f695757bdd6c4ea04f82e7f620b" >Check at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Performance"><a href="#Performance" class="headerlink" title="Performance"></a>Performance</h2><p> This Sony player is capable enough to perform much better as compared to its price tag. It successfully passed the real words and synthetic image tests on DVD as well as Blu-Ray content. Tests were performed with comparison to high end LG 4K OLED device and the results were quite surprising as this Sony device performed equally good.</p><p> On the other side, if we talk about its playback speed then Sony was not found as fast as its competitors. It took about 24.9 seconds to work with Netflix whereas overall time of 11.26 seconds was taken for starting Mission Impossible III. However, the difference was not much from ratings of LG GP350 but still if you consider speed as your prime concern for performance then it is good to look for Samsun J5900.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/S3700-1.jpg"                                     ></p><h2 id="Verdict"><a href="#Verdict" class="headerlink" title="Verdict"></a>Verdict</h2><p> Sony possesses almost all features of popular Blu-Ray players in year 2016 and with the new release of 2017; Sony has worked well on improvements. Picture quality is not the big issue for selection because almost all players below $500 range offer similar kind of performance but the main consideration for selection should be speed as it is going to cause major change in performance. As S3700 is rated as a solid performer over so many features so it can be preferred for home theatre applications. Its combination of smart functions, decent sound and durable design make it stand out against all competing models in market.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Ollie Mattison</p><p>Ollie Mattison is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Ollie Mattison</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-inverting-image-hues-in-photoshop-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Inverting Image Hues in Photoshop for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-increasing-visibility-with-strategic-reddit-posts-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Increasing Visibility with Strategic Reddit Posts for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-sharp-as-day-the-top10-clearer-photo-editors-list/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Sharp as Day  The #Top10 Clearer Photo Editors List</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-meditative-harmony-top-free-no-copyright-playlists-for-2024/"><u>[New] Meditative Harmony – Top Free, No-Copyright Playlists for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/in-2024-utilizing-b-roll-to-enrich-narrative-arcs/"><u>In 2024, Utilizing B-Roll to Enrich Narrative Arcs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-quick-launch-checklist-essential-tasks-for-bringing-your-review-channel-to-life/"><u>[New] Quick Launch Checklist  Essential Tasks for Bringing Your Review Channel to Life</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-designing-multi-layered-photographic-illusions/"><u>[New] In 2024, Designing Multi-Layered Photographic Illusions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-pushing-boundaries-the-complete-breakdown-of-vce-22/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Pushing Boundaries  The Complete Breakdown of VCE 2.2</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-building-your-hyperlapse-filmmaking-toolkit-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Building Your Hyperlapse Filmmaking Toolkit for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-prime-panzoid-layout-libraries/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Prime Panzoid Layout Libraries</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/in-2024-crafting-realistic-3d-text-designs-in-photoshop/"><u>In 2024, Crafting Realistic 3D Text Designs in Photoshop</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/updated-from-still-shots-to-soundscapes-an-instagram-mp3-journey/"><u>[Updated] From Still Shots to Soundscapes  An Instagram-MP3 Journey</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/in-2024-master-the-art-of-clean-up-a-guide-to-bg-elimination/"><u>In 2024, Master the Art of Clean-Up  A Guide to BG Elimination</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/in-2024-expert-choices-for-tiktok-video-to-gif-transformations/"><u>In 2024, Expert Choices for TikTok Video to GIF Transformations</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-unlock-your-apple-iphone-12-pro-passcode-4-easy-methods-with-or-without-itunes-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, How to Unlock Your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Passcode 4 Easy Methods (With or Without iTunes) | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-apps.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-10-best-animated-text-generator-to-use-100-useful/"><u>Updated 2024 Approved 10 Best Animated Text Generator to Use (100 Useful)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-halt-youtube-suggested-content-now/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Halt YouTube Suggested Content Now</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/in-2024-complete-tutorial-to-use-gps-joystick-to-fake-gps-location-on-realme-11x-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Complete Tutorial to Use GPS Joystick to Fake GPS Location On Realme 11X 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/in-2024-epic-eats-escapades-toptiktokfoodies/"><u>In 2024, Epic Eats Escapades  #TopTiktokFoodies</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-outro-crafting-for-beginners-top-6-free-resources/"><u>[Updated] Outro Crafting for Beginners  Top 6 Free Resources</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>
