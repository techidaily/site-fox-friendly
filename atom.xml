It makes the content editing process a hassle-free, creative, and enjoyable activity. Also, beginners and amateur content editors can easily use Affinity Photo.</p><p>No matter you are a professional content creator or a newbie, we’ll be discussing how to remove background in Affinity Photo. Let’s explore how to use the good editing tool to be free of the stressful editing process.</p><h2 id="How-to-Remove-Affinity-Photo-to-Remove-Image’s-Background"><a href="#How-to-Remove-Affinity-Photo-to-Remove-Image’s-Background" class="headerlink" title="How to Remove Affinity Photo to Remove Image’s Background"></a>How to Remove Affinity Photo to Remove Image’s Background</h2><p>Affinity Photo is a simple and easy-to-use editing software, and you can remove a background in it under two scenarios: remove a white or a busy background.</p><h3 id="How-to-Erase-a-White-Background-in-Affinity-Designer"><a href="#How-to-Erase-a-White-Background-in-Affinity-Designer" class="headerlink" title="How to Erase a White Background in Affinity Designer"></a>How to Erase a White Background in Affinity Designer</h3><p>To erase a white background in Affinity Designer, do these steps:</p><p>Step1 In the first step, install the <a class="link"   href="https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/designer/" >Affinity Designer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>software and launch it on your computer. Go to <strong>“File” &gt; “Open”</strong> and head to the location of your image with a white background on your drive to import it.</p><p>Now access the <strong>Pixel Persona</strong> section in the left corner of the software screen by clicking the <strong>colored boxes</strong> icon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/accessing-the-pixel-persona-in-affinity-designer.png"                      alt="accessing the pixel persona in affinity designer"                ></p><p>Step2 Go to the <strong>“Layers”</strong> tab in the right pane, right-click your layer, and disable <strong>“Lock.”</strong> Now right-click on your layer again, and select <strong>“Rasterize”</strong> to enable editing of specific parts of the image.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/unlocking-the-image-layer-in-affinity-designer.png"                      alt="unlocking the image layer in affinity designer"                ></p><p>Step3 To make a selection around your subject, first enable the <strong>“Snap To Edges”</strong> and <strong>“Soft Edges”</strong> feature from the top toolbar. This will help you automatically detect the edges and give it a more tapered finish.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/enabling-snap-to-edges-and-soft-edges-in-affinity-designer.png"                      alt="enabling snap to edges and soft edges in affinity designer"                ></p><p>Set your brush size using your keyboard’s <strong>left</strong> and <strong>right bracket</strong> keys. Now, manually make a selection around your subject and white edges in the image as precisely as possible.</p><p>Step4 Next, zoom in on your subject. Press &amp; hold the ALT key on your keyboard, and use the Selection Brush tool to manually correct the rough edges of your outline.</p><p>Click the <strong>“Refine”</strong> option in the toolbar to open the <strong>“Refine Selection”</strong> menu. A red mask will be applied to your subject, giving you an idea of how your image will look once you remove the background. Zoom in and if any details are excluded, paint them over. Once you are satisfied, click <strong>“Apply”</strong> to save your changes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/refining-the-outline-around-the-image-to-remove-background-in-affinity-designer.png"                      alt="refining the outline around the image to remove background in affinity designer"                ></p><p>Step5 In the last step, press the <strong>“Delete”</strong> key on your keyboard to remove the background, or click <strong>“Edit”</strong> and choose the <strong>“Cut”</strong> option.</p><p>Now, hit <strong>“Control+D”</strong> to deselect the selection. Alternatively, you can click <strong>“Select”</strong> in the top toolbar and choose the <strong>“Deselect”</strong> option. Finally, you can export your file using the <strong>“File” &gt; “Export”</strong> option.</p><h3 id="How-to-Remove-a-Busy-Background-in-Affinity-Designer"><a href="#How-to-Remove-a-Busy-Background-in-Affinity-Designer" class="headerlink" title="How to Remove a Busy Background in Affinity Designer"></a>How to Remove a Busy Background in Affinity Designer</h3><p>If you want to remove a busy background of an image in the Affinity Designer software, follow these steps carefully:</p><p>Step1 Click the <strong>“File”</strong> option in Affinity Designer and select <strong>“Open”</strong> from the drop-down menu. Select your image and click <strong>“Open”</strong> to import your picture.</p><p>From the right-side panel, open the <strong>Layers</strong> tab and click the <strong>“Lock”</strong> icon to unlock your image layer, which is set as locked by default. Now, right-click on the layer and select <strong>“Rasterize &amp; Trim.”</strong> Rasterization will help remove the background.</p><p>Step2 Next, you have to make a selection around your object&#x2F;subject in the picture. Click the <strong>“Selection Brush”</strong> tool from the left-side panel to do so.</p><p>Now your cursor will be changed to a circle. To increase or decrease the brush size, use the <strong>Right</strong> and <strong>Left Bracket</strong> keys on your keyboard. Now, move around the brush on your image to outline your subject.</p><p>Step3 Once you’ve made a selection around your object, it’s time to refine it to make it more precise. To do so, click the <strong>“Refine”</strong> option from the top toolbar to open the <strong>“Refine Selection”</strong> menu.</p><p>Focus on the <strong>Foreground</strong> and <strong>Background</strong> brushes in the <strong>Refine Selection</strong> menu and toggle between these settings to make your selection more accurate. You can use the <strong>Right or Left Bracket</strong> key on your keyboard to adjust the brush size where needed.<br>Once satisfied with your changes, click the <strong>“Apply”</strong> option in the <strong>Refine Selection</strong> menu to save your settings.</p><p>Step4 Now that you’ve outlined your subject clearly and precisely, it’s time to remove the busy background. To do so, click the <strong>Delete key</strong> on your keyboard if you use a Windows PC.</p><p>If you are using a Mac system, click <strong>“Edit”</strong> in the toolbar and select <strong>“Cut”</strong> from the drop-down menu. Your background will be removed and changed to a checkboard pattern.</p><p>Step5 In this last step, you must deselect the outline around your subject. For this, press the <strong>“Control+D”</strong> key on your keyboard or click <strong>“Select”</strong> in the toolbar and choose the <strong>“Deselect”</strong> option.</p><p>Finally, click <strong>“File”</strong> and select the <strong>“Export”</strong> option from the drop-down menu. Then, in the Export Settings menu, choose PNG and click <strong>“Export”</strong> to save your file on your PC.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"                                     ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068425/7443" target="_top" id="2068425"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068425"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068425/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>Note:</strong> To save your image with a transparent background, do not export it in JPG file format.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.emeditor.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4610657&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.emeditor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/emeditor_chat_ai.png"                      border="0"                ><br>EmEditor is a fast, lightweight, yet extensible, easy-to-use text editor, code editor, CSV editor, and large file viewer for Windows.

Below are few important tips to gain more followers&#x2F;viewers on Periscope:</p><p> 1. Once you have gained lots of knowledge and expertise in a particular area then it is good to develop few scopes so that you can easily share your hints and tips related to that topic. The #hash tag feature helps to attract more audience towards your posts.</p><p> 2. The most essential task that you need to focus upon during your upload is to add eye catching titles for your content. Words of your title can make huge difference as few have power to grab more audience whereas others can suffer more ignorance. The rule is to follow relevant content marketing boosted titles phrases.</p><p> 3. Make some efforts to encourage viewers to send more hearts for your broadcasts. More hearts means you will achieve higher rank on periscope. If you share your scope then viewers can go through it for next 24 hours.</p><p> 4. The powerful solution to grow size of your audience is to stay active to collaborate with other Periscope users. This tip can add more value to your business when you start working in collaboration with other experts.</p><p> 5. Never forget to turn on that Twitter sign while posting your content on scope.</p><p> 6. Update your location details time to time.</p><p> 7. Try to build a strong community and always share a valuable content as per interest of your viewers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://united.elfm.net/c/5597632/748964/4704" target="_top" id="748964"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/4704-748964"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://united.elfm.net/i/5597632/748964/4704"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-creative-starter-kit-no-cost-ae-visual-aids/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Creative Starter Kit  No-Cost AE Visual Aids</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-enhance-your-iphone-hd-video-clarity-in-premiere-pro-effortlessly/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Enhance Your iPhone HD Video Clarity in Premiere Pro Effortlessly</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-photoshop-picmaster-guide-and-assessment/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Photoshop PicMaster  Guide & Assessment</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-unlocking-the-potential-a-compreayers-guide-to-batched-video-downloads-from-tiktok/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Unlocking the Potential  A Compreayer's Guide to Batched Video Downloads From TikTok</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-air-lift-extraordinaire-top-industrial-drones-for-2024/"><u>[New] Air-Lift Extraordinaire  Top Industrial Drones for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-decoding-dynamic-range-sdr-vs-hdr-in-cinematic-workflows/"><u>[New] Decoding Dynamic Range  SDR Vs.

Although iPhone X is one of the best gadgets in the recent times, it can be pretty complex too. In spite of using the device now, you may not know the hidden <strong>iPhone X tips and tricks</strong>, which Apple keeps adding with each software upgrade. In order to make your daily usage of iPhone X device simple and easy, here are the 10 iPhone X tips and tricks. Run the latest iOS version and get going with these missing features.</p><h2 id="10-Hidden-iPhone-X-Tips-and-Tricks"><a href="#10-Hidden-iPhone-X-Tips-and-Tricks" class="headerlink" title="10 Hidden iPhone X Tips and Tricks"></a>10 Hidden iPhone X Tips and Tricks</h2><h4 id="1-Take-a-Screenshot-using-iPhone-X-tips-and-tricks"><a href="#1-Take-a-Screenshot-using-iPhone-X-tips-and-tricks" class="headerlink" title="1. Take a Screenshot using iPhone X tips and tricks"></a>1. Take a Screenshot using iPhone X tips and tricks</h4><p>Are you used to taking screenshots pressing the side button and the home button? What will you do with your iPhone X? It has no home button. Forget all your worries as the iPhone X tips and tricks help in easing your worries instantly. To take a screenshot on your iPhone X, press the side button and the volume up button simultaneously. The rest of the working is exactly as you see in other iPhones.</p><h4 id="2-Hard-Reset"><a href="#2-Hard-Reset" class="headerlink" title="2. Hard Reset"></a>2. Hard Reset</h4><p>What, if your iPhone X becomes unresponsive? iPhone X tips and tricks help you to force hard reset the iPhone X by swiftly pressing the volume up button first, then pressing the volume down button, and finally pressing and holding the side button. Apart from holding the side button, do not hold any of the volume buttons. You can observe the Apple logo when you hold the side button for 10-15 seconds and leave it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iPhone-X-Hard-Reset-Buttons-min.png"                      alt="hard reset"                ></p><h4 id="3-Battery-Percentage"><a href="#3-Battery-Percentage" class="headerlink" title="3. Battery Percentage"></a>3. Battery Percentage</h4><p>The iOS doesn’t feature a default battery percentage display. But, the settings can be used to turn on the display for battery percentage. The iPhone X is different, the setting has been removed from this device but don’t you worry. Just from the right side of the notch, swipe down and the option is integrated into the control center.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iOS_battery_percentage.jpg"                      alt="battery percentage"                ></p><h4 id="4-Virtual-Home-Button"><a href="#4-Virtual-Home-Button" class="headerlink" title="4. Virtual Home Button"></a>4. Virtual Home Button</h4><p>Are you missing the home button feature on your iPhone X device? Unfortunately, it is not really possible to bring it back physically but replicating the home button is definitely possible with the use of the software. So, what is the procedure to get a home button replica? Go to the general, click on the accessibility feature, then click on the assistive touch, and finally toggle it on. A virtual home button appears on the screen which you may modify to activate the shortcuts.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-home-button.jpg"                      alt="home button"                ></p><h4 id="5-Optimize-Face-Id"><a href="#5-Optimize-Face-Id" class="headerlink" title="5. Optimize Face Id"></a>5. Optimize Face Id</h4><p>However fast the face ID is, at times, it cannot match up with the touch ID. But, the process of face ID can be accelerated with right habits and settings.</p><p>Firstly, click on the settings and then on the display and brightness feature to ensure “raise to wake” feature is enabled to stop you from having to tap on the screen. Swipe the phone upside so that your face is not seen directly on the screen and the face id gets time to authenticate and when you look to unlock your iPhone with the face ID, it directly takes you to the home screen. You may click on settings and then passcode and face ID to find the “require attention for face ID” feature to unlock the phone without looking directly on the screen. These iPhone X tips and tricks can greatly help to optimize the face ID.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/settings-face-id2.jpg"                      alt="face id"                ></p><h4 id="6-Quickly-Return-Home"><a href="#6-Quickly-Return-Home" class="headerlink" title="6. Quickly Return Home"></a>6. Quickly Return Home</h4><p>If there’s an opened app screen on your iPhone X, you may go back to the home screen by using the home indicator. And, if multiple app pages are opened on your device’s home screen, you may swipe from the bottom edge which takes you back to the first page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/home-indicator-iphone-x.jpg"                      alt="return home"                ></p><h4 id="7-Instantly-Open-the-Camera"><a href="#7-Instantly-Open-the-Camera" class="headerlink" title="7. Instantly Open the Camera"></a>7. Instantly Open the Camera</h4><p>Do you want to have the instant camera feature on your iPhone X? Just swipe from right to the left to disclose the camera. You may also 3D Touch the camera icon by pressing the lock screen icon for long. As you long press the lockscreen icon, the camera is revealed for you to take the snapshots.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-x-open-camera.jpg"                      alt="open camera"                ></p><h4 id="8-Activate-Siri"><a href="#8-Activate-Siri" class="headerlink" title="8. Activate Siri"></a>8. Activate Siri</h4><p>In order to access Siri, press the side button for long without giving any voice command and activate Siri.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/siri.jpg"                      alt="siri"                ></p><h4 id="9-Use-Reachability-Again"><a href="#9-Use-Reachability-Again" class="headerlink" title="9. Use Reachability Again"></a>9. Use Reachability Again</h4><p>Do you miss the reachability feature where the display would slide down to reach the icons with one hand on the top of the screen by just a double touch on the home button? Why miss, when you can get it? Yes, the feature has not been removed from the iPhone X but it has just been hidden. Go to the general settings, click on the accessibility feature and scroll down to interaction to enable the reachability. For using the reachability feature, on the home bar bottom of the screen instantly swipe.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Accessibility.png"                      alt="Accessibility"                ></p><h4 id="10-Flip-Between-Recent-Apps"><a href="#10-Flip-Between-Recent-Apps" class="headerlink" title="10. Flip Between Recent Apps"></a>10. Flip Between Recent Apps</h4><p>This is a familiar iPhone X functionality but you might have missed it while setting up your device. It is common for all of us to go through the tutorial quickly and then get to the phone. Isn’t it? But, if you have still missed it, then, from the home screen swipe right on the gesture bar. Now, you can quickly get into flipping between suspended apps. Furthermore, if you have flipped to an app that was not the last opened app, you can swipe both left and right.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-x-multitasking.jpg"                      alt="Flip Between Recent Apps"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Keeping the iPhone X tips and tricks in mind, you get to access all the new and more handy iPhone X device. The iOS brings with it several new tips and tricks. These handy options work with the iPhone X. Never forget to update your iPhone with the latest and updated version of the software as you may come to learn a number of other iPhone X tips and tricks with each update.</p><p><img

New updates of the app always bring new features, but many users miss out on the minute new changes and feature add-ons that are meant to make the overall experience and usability a lot easier and more fun. So here is a jotted down list of the coolest <strong>WhatsApp Tricks</strong> that you may not know of yet.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Cool WhatsApp Text Tricks to Make You Look Edgy</a></li><li><a href="#part2">What are the Hidden Features of WhatsApp?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Edit WhatsApp Videos with Ease</a></li></ul><h2 id="Cool-WhatsApp-Text-Tricks-to-Make-You-Look-Edgy"><a href="#Cool-WhatsApp-Text-Tricks-to-Make-You-Look-Edgy" class="headerlink" title="Cool WhatsApp Text Tricks to Make You Look Edgy"></a>Cool WhatsApp Text Tricks to Make You Look Edgy</h2><p>You can do a lot of things with your WhatsApp fonts, appearance, and texts that will make your messages look oh-so-edgy! From italics, bold, strikethrough to monospace there are plenty of text formatting tricks to dress up your epic announcements, festive greetings et al. Rounding it all, here are the best WhatsApp Typing Tricks you can use right away.</p><h4 id="1-Bold"><a href="#1-Bold" class="headerlink" title="1.Bold"></a>1.Bold</h4><p>Yes, you can bold your text. Just add a star (*) symbol before and after your text. Don’t use space between the * and the letter.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-text-tricks-bold.jpg"                      alt="Whatsapp Text Tricks Bold"                ></p><h4 id="2-Italic"><a href="#2-Italic" class="headerlink" title="2.Italic"></a>2.Italic</h4><p>Just like the bold, you can also italicize your fonts by simply inserting Underscore Symbol ( _text_ ) at the starting and end of your sentence.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-text-tricks-italic.jpg"                      alt="Whatsapp Text Tricks Italic"                ></p><h4 id="3-Strikethrough"><a href="#3-Strikethrough" class="headerlink" title="3.Strikethrough"></a>3.Strikethrough</h4><p>Strikethrough is largely used to intend puns in WhatsApp, but sometimes it is also a functional tool for text corrections, used at large for online tutorials, editorials, or brainstorming. For adding Strikethrough use the Tilde Symbol (~text~) at the starting and end of your text.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-text-tricks-strikethrough.png"                      alt="Whatsapp Text Tricks Strikethrough"                ></p><h4 id="4-Monospace"><a href="#4-Monospace" class="headerlink" title="4.Monospace"></a>4.Monospace</h4><p>The monospace is a font stylization now available in WhatsApp that allows you to write fixed-width content. These WhatsApp writing tricks are useful when sharing any sort of coding or technical formulas. It will help distinguish special content from regular content. To insert it, use 3 backticks (```text```) at the beginning and end of your sentence without spacing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-text-tricks-monospace.png"                      alt="Whatsapp Text Tricks Monospace"                ></p><h4 id="5-Disable-Read-Recipients"><a href="#5-Disable-Read-Recipients" class="headerlink" title="5.Disable Read Recipients"></a>5.Disable Read Recipients</h4><p>WhatsApp introduced the Blue Tick feature to notify users when their messages are not only delivered but are seen by the recipients. But it has also been the cause of fallouts between loved ones and even trouble at work for failing to respond despite a Blue Tick. Now you can control the fury with WhatsApp Text Tricks of disabling the Read Recipient feature. Go Settings &gt;&gt; Account &gt;&gt; Privacy &gt;&gt; Read Recipients. By doing this, you won’t be able to see your contact’s blue ticks as no one will be able to see yours. Unlike custom notifications, the Read Recipient feature applies to your entire contact list and cannot be used for one specific contact. The sender would see black double ticks even if you read the message.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-disable-read-recipients.png"                      alt="Whatsapp Disable Read Recipients"                ></p><h4 id="6-Pin-Prioritized-Contacts"><a href="#6-Pin-Prioritized-Contacts" class="headerlink" title="6.Pin Prioritized Contacts"></a>6.Pin Prioritized Contacts</h4><p>Many times, we have just one or a few people whose texts matter the most. So, avoid letting those important message threads from getting pushed down below by message floods. You can pin priority contacts by opening WhatsApp, then tapping and holding the chat thread of the contact without opening it. This will show a new toolbar on the green border at the top of the window. Use the first icon of a pin to freeze the chat thread in the top position.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-pin-prioritized-contacts.jpg"                      alt="Whatsapp Pin Prioritized Contacts"                ></p><p>Source: techmesto.com</p><h4 id="7-Export-Chat-Logs"><a href="#7-Export-Chat-Logs" class="headerlink" title="7.Export Chat Logs"></a>7.Export Chat Logs</h4><p>If you wish to save the chats that you exchanged with someone special, you can email the entire chat thread to yourself or someone else, you can even save it to Drive. Open the chat thread and tap on the 3 dots icon, then click &gt;&gt;More&lt;&lt; and then click on &gt;&gt;Export Chat&lt;&lt;. This will open a host of options allowing you to export your chat logs to a multitude of destinations.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-export-chat-logs.png"                      alt="Whatsapp Export Chat Logs"                ></p><h4 id="8-WhatsApp-Font-Tricks-for-Formatting"><a href="#8-WhatsApp-Font-Tricks-for-Formatting" class="headerlink" title="8.WhatsApp Font Tricks for Formatting"></a>8.WhatsApp Font Tricks for Formatting</h4><p>Though we have already mentioned the shortcuts for bold, italics, and other text formatting features, there is another way to format your texts if you forget the shortcuts - go for the Native Settings Strip. Once you are done typing, then tap and hold the text sections you want to format, this will open all the options in a list. You can scroll it to select your formatting command.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-font-tricks-formatting.png"                      alt="Whatsapp Font Tricks Formatting"                ></p><h4 id="9-You-Can-Apply-All-WhatsApp-Font-Tricks-on-One-Word-or-Sentence"><a href="#9-You-Can-Apply-All-WhatsApp-Font-Tricks-on-One-Word-or-Sentence" class="headerlink" title="9.You Can Apply All WhatsApp Font Tricks on One Word or Sentence"></a>9.You Can Apply All WhatsApp Font Tricks on One Word or Sentence</h4><p>There are plenty of things you can do with one word. It can be bold, italic, monospace, and strikethrough all at the same time. Apply the native settings or shortcuts one after another and voila!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/apply-all-whatsapp-font-tricks.png"                      alt="Apply All Whatsapp Font Tricks"                ></p><h4 id="10-Share-Sections-of-Messages-While-Typing"><a href="#10-Share-Sections-of-Messages-While-Typing" class="headerlink" title="10.Share Sections of Messages While Typing"></a>10.Share Sections of Messages While Typing</h4><p>While typing a WhatsApp message if you need to cross-check certain areas with someone else, and don’t want to copy the text or overwrite your clipboard, you can directly share the text without copy-pasting or taking screenshots. This WhatsApp Typing Trick is in the same native setting strip mentioned earlier, which you can access by tapping and holding the text section you want to share, which will open the formatting strip. Once it opens then click on the 3 dots, which will turn the strip into a panel, in the panel you will find what you are looking for. The coolest part is that you can share the text not only in WhatsApp but multiple other apps like Zoom, Skype, Email… even Bluetooth!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-typing-trick.png"                      alt="Whatsapp Typing Trick"                ></p><h2 id="What-are-the-Hidden-Features-of-WhatsApp"><a href="#What-are-the-Hidden-Features-of-WhatsApp" class="headerlink" title="What are the Hidden Features of WhatsApp?"></a>What are the Hidden Features of WhatsApp?</h2><p>Since most of the above-mentioned are owing to the tricks and trades of texting via WhatsApp, let us now jot down a WhatsApp hidden feature list that applies for general usability of the wonder-app. There are useful privacy settings and chat features that can make your user experience a lot more peaceful.</p><h4 id="1-Broadcast-Announcements"><a href="#1-Broadcast-Announcements" class="headerlink" title="1.Broadcast Announcements"></a>1.Broadcast Announcements</h4><p>Never be caught up creating a group for a one-time cause and see it becoming some sort of a messaging hub for the group members, leaving you to eat their all-day chatter while exiting would be too rude. Chuck the drama with Broadcast! On earlier versions of WhatsApp conveying a message to multiple contacts would either need you to share the message one by one with your contacts or create a group. While the sharing part is not a problem other than being time-consuming, the problem with the group is that all recipients can see each other, and things can get out of control. So now you have the Broadcast Feature wherein you can send a single text to multiple contacts privately and all at once. Open WhatsApp and click on the 3-dot button on the top left and you will find broadcast - every click will direct you to the next step.</p><h4 id="2-Save-More-Data"><a href="#2-Save-More-Data" class="headerlink" title="2.Save More Data"></a>2.Save More Data</h4><p>There are many ways how you can save mobile data consumed by WhatsApp. First, you can reduce the data consumption while on call, secondly, control the downloading of media when mobile data is running. You will find both the customization options under Data and Storage in your WhatsApp settings.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-save-more-data.png"                      alt="Whatsapp Save More Data"                ></p><p>Source: androidauthority.com</p><h4 id="3-Share-Your-Location-Without-Ado"><a href="#3-Share-Your-Location-Without-Ado" class="headerlink" title="3.Share Your Location Without Ado"></a>3.Share Your Location Without Ado</h4><p>If there is confusion with a location, where sharing addresses is not an option, for example, getting lost in an amusement park - the easiest way to direct your mates within 20 meters of your exact position is by sharing your “location” via WhatsApp. This feature is tucked in the attachment options. Just as you share contacts, images and other stuff, click on Location and it will put you in the right direction.</p><h4 id="4-Search-Old-Chats-with-Keywords"><a href="#4-Search-Old-Chats-with-Keywords" class="headerlink" title="4.Search Old Chats with Keywords"></a>4.Search Old Chats with Keywords</h4><p>As long as you have the chat history intact you can search specific words to trace an old chat within a thread. Open the message thread of the specific contact, tap on the 3 Dots button on the top left and click on “Search”. Then type a word from the particular chat, hit enter to trace it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-search-old-chat.png"                      alt="Whatsapp Search Old Chat"                ></p><h4 id="5-Restore-Your-Chat-History-and-Deleted-Chats"><a href="#5-Restore-Your-Chat-History-and-Deleted-Chats" class="headerlink" title="5.Restore Your Chat History, and Deleted Chats"></a>5.Restore Your Chat History, and Deleted Chats</h4><p>Sometimes you can restore deleted chat history if you have switched sims or mistakenly deleted a special conversation thread. Doesn’t take too much, just uninstall and reinstall your app. On opening it, you will get the prompt to restore your chats and media. The restoration process takes about a minute depending on internet speed. Then tap NEXT when the prompt appears. Remember this trick only works on messages that are run under backup when you are using a new phone. WhatsApp runs a backup every day at 2 am.</p><h4 id="6-Snooze-WhatsApp"><a href="#6-Snooze-WhatsApp" class="headerlink" title="6.Snooze WhatsApp"></a>6.Snooze WhatsApp</h4><p>Sometimes you just need to hush your WhatsApp for just a while. Perhaps you have to lend your phone to someone but don’t want them bumping into any of your private incoming messages. While other social media allow “logging off”, WhatsApp is always there in your face! Though high-fidelity phones allow fingerprint and face locking, not everyone owns a compatible device right now. Yet you don’t have to delete the app or go Aeroplane Mode, just force stop it. Though it is not an inbuilt WhatsApp feature, you can control the gamut by going to Settings&gt;&gt; Apps and Notifications &gt;&gt; WhatsApp &gt;&gt; Disable. Then in the same section go to Data Settings and disable Background Data. If you do this, your messages will come but you won’t’ get them until you open the app, meanwhile, keep receiving calls and all use your phone full-fledged.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-hidden-feature-snooze-whatsapp.png"                      alt="Whatsapp Hidden Feature Snooze Whatsapp"                ></p><h4 id="7-Automatically-Delete-Messages-After-7-Days"><a href="#7-Automatically-Delete-Messages-After-7-Days" class="headerlink" title="7.Automatically Delete Messages After 7 Days"></a>7.Automatically Delete Messages After 7 Days</h4><p>Not every message thread is important, and many people have the habit of deleting messages just to feel organized. WhatsApp brings some zero-effort minimalism for you with this new feature available for Android users. Update your app and visit the contact’s page in WhatsApp and you will be able to see the “Disappearing Messages” option. If you enable this, your chats with the particular contact will be deleted automatically on their own.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-auto-delete-messages.png"                      alt="Whatsapp Auto Delete Messages"                ></p><h4 id="8-Mute-Stories-that-You-Don’t-Want-to-See"><a href="#8-Mute-Stories-that-You-Don’t-Want-to-See" class="headerlink" title="8.Mute Stories that You Don’t Want to See"></a>8.Mute Stories that You Don’t Want to See</h4><p>If it is annoying to open a loved one’s story and then automatically sliding into a story you did not want to open, you can MUTE the people whose stories you are not interested to see. Go to Story and tap and hold the unwanted contact to open the Mute option. Even though there is no option that you can stop the automatic carousel to the next contact’s stories altogether, you can always go by the rule of the thumb - place your thumb on the screen and the carousel won’t move.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mute-whatsapp-stories.jpg"                      alt="Mute Whatsapp Stories"                ></p><h4 id="9-Reply-Privately-to-Recipients-in-a-WhatsApp-Group"><a href="#9-Reply-Privately-to-Recipients-in-a-WhatsApp-Group" class="headerlink" title="9.Reply Privately to Recipients in a WhatsApp Group"></a>9.Reply Privately to Recipients in a WhatsApp Group</h4><p>This is as simple as it sounds. Tap and hold to select a message in a group and then open the 3-dot button at the top right to access the feature.</p><h4 id="10-Customize-Notifications-for-Specific-Contacts"><a href="#10-Customize-Notifications-for-Specific-Contacts" class="headerlink" title="10.Customize Notifications for Specific Contacts"></a>10.Customize Notifications for Specific Contacts</h4><p>Manage how you are notified of messages from specific contacts and groups. Go to the main page of the contact or group you wish to customize, and there you will find Custom Notifications. Activate the mode to open a wide range of options - notification tones, pop up, preview, etc.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/whatsapp-hidden-feature-custom-notification.jpg"                      alt="Whatsapp Hidden Feature Custom Notification"                ></p><p>Source: beebom.com</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://checkout.mirillis.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4704640&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/547a5a56d43f6d40f9a6a2f76501d013/products/1_mirillis_action_boxshot_store_1x.jpg"                      border="0"                ><br>    Home Use license is dedicated for personal, non-commercial use only.<br>    If Action! is used for commercial gain or to further any commercial purpose,<br>    a Commercial Use license is required.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Best-Caller-ID-Changers-Their-Enchanting-Alternatives"><a href="#Best-Caller-ID-Changers-Their-Enchanting-Alternatives" class="headerlink" title="Best Caller ID Changers &amp; Their Enchanting Alternatives"></a>Best Caller ID Changers &amp; Their Enchanting Alternatives</h2><p>The <strong>Magic Call voice changer app</strong> is a mobile app that can make prank calls by changing your voice into male, female, cartoon, and more. In addition, the <strong>Magic Call app</strong> allows you to customize the background of your calls with sound effects like rain, traffic, music concert, rain, and more. Just select a contact and start your Magic Call. But as good as it comes, many users complain that Magic Call doesn’t work as intended. Is that true? We dive into the app to bring you this first-hand experience.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try AI Voice Changer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try AI Voice Changer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><h2 id="Part-1-Is-the-Magic-Call-app-really-working"><a href="#Part-1-Is-the-Magic-Call-app-really-working" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Is the Magic Call app really working?"></a>Part 1: Is the Magic Call app really working?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/magic-call-voice-changer-app-1.jpg"                      alt="magic call voice changer app on app store"                ></p><p>So, does <a class="link"   href="http://www.magiccall.co/" >Magic Call <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> work, or is it just another over-hyped app on Play Store and App Store? For starters, the fact that the app is on Play Store and App Store means it has been tested to ensure users have a trusted experience. However, you’ll notice that the app is rated 2.3 stars on Play Store, which is far from reassuring.</p><p>Some reviewers often complain that Magic Call doesn’t run properly. For example, one review claims the app hangs for at least an hour after clicking the “Continue” button. Another common problem with Magic Call is the failure to send the OTS SMS to the number you provide. Some reviewers also claim that the app doesn’t send fake calls, although they can hear their phone ringing.</p><p>In our first-hand review of the app, we noticed that the app couldn’t send an OTP to our phone number. However, we contacted their support, and this was sorted out almost instantly. Besides that, the app works fine, although with limited choices of voice effects. In addition, Magic Call gives new users 2 minutes of free call time, after which you’ll have to purchase call credits.

People like me who work as freelancers or in different companies now use Zoom for numerous work calls and daily virtual meets. It doesn’t matter if you have a laptop or a smartphone you can put Zoom to use anytime.</p><p>So if you have a query, “is Zoom in android actually a thing?” and if you are new to Zoom, don’t know how to start or join a Zoom meeting on Android, and how to schedule it, this step-wise process will help you out. So before making that Zoom call, here is everything you must understand and be aware of:</p><ol><li><a href="#part2-1">Join Zoom meeting using the Zoom URL on Android</a></li><li><a href="#part2-2">Join Zoom meetings using a Zoom ID on Android</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part3">How to Schedule a Zoom Meeting Android</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Start-a-Zoom-Meeting-on-Android"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Start-a-Zoom-Meeting-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. How to Start a Zoom Meeting on Android"></a>Part 1. How to Start a Zoom Meeting on Android</h2><p>There is no doubt that the Zoom app on an android device is easy to navigate through and put to use. All the features are pretty visible and can be used with ease. Also, the phone camera is much better in quality and hence, you can make calls with better visibility of yourself to whom you have called. You just have to opt for downloading the Zoom app by using the Google Play Store. Then you can opt for the creation of an account and you can put Zoom to use right away. Here’s how you get started with a meeting using Zoom on an Android phone:</p><ul><li>On the left side, in the upper corner, opt for clicking on the option “<strong>New Meeting.</strong>“</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/schedule-zoom-meeting-android-1.jpg"                      alt="new zoom meeting android"                ></p><ul><li>Now, opt for the selection of “<strong>Start a Meeting.</strong>“ Once done, you will notice a video conference space.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/schedule-zoom-meeting-android-2.jpg"                      alt="start a zoom meeting android"                ></p><ul><li>At this point, you will see a pop-up with the “<strong>Got it</strong>“ button on it. Click on it so you can provide a permit to Zoom to access the microphone and camera of the device you are using.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/schedule-zoom-meeting-android-3.jpg"                      alt="zoom access permission android"                ></p><ul><li>Now, you will see a window pop-up asking you to provide access to Zoom to record a video or click a picture. Click on the button “<strong>Allow</strong>“</li><li>Now, at this point, the screen of your device will have the option “<strong>Participants,</strong>“. This option you can opt to use for the addition of one or more people to your meeting.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/schedule-zoom-meeting-android-4.jpg"                      alt="allow more participants"                ></p><ul><li>Now, opt for clicking on “<strong>Invite</strong>“. Here, after this, you will see a menu. This menu will have a few options you can choose from so you can send guest invites. Also, using Zoom’s contacts option, you may invite people by sending an email or sharing the invite link, and so on. So it’s pretty simple to use in that sense.</li><li>Now, you have to press “<strong>Send Email</strong>“ by putting everyone’s email address and now, click on the “<strong>Send</strong>“ button.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/schedule-zoom-meeting-android-5.jpg"                      alt="send email zoom meeting"                ></p><p>Also, when it comes to copying the meeting’s hyperlink, you can opt to tap on the “<strong>Copy invite link</strong>“ option on your device.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Join-an-existing-Zoom-Meeting-on-Android"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Join-an-existing-Zoom-Meeting-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to Join an existing Zoom Meeting on Android"></a>Part 2. How to Join an existing Zoom Meeting on Android</h2><p>So if you have downloaded the Zoom app, made an account, and have to join a meeting on Zoom on Android TV or phone that’s already in process, you can do it with the help of the Zoom URL or Zoom ID. This is if someone else is probably hosting it this time. It’s not difficult to do so and here’s how you can opt for a Zoom android TV or&#x2F;and phone virtual meet-up:</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1993652">                    <video width="720" height="300" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993652.jpeg"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1993652">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993652.jpeg"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:720px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1993652%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1993652/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->### Join Zoom meeting using the Zoom URL on Android<ul><li>Opt for clicking the meeting link that you have gotten in your email or wherever else.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/schedule-zoom-meeting-android-6.jpg"                      alt="click zoom meeting link"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=45152810&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/842ca578342915ccb8ae069595ba7233/products/copy_bootit-ss1_178x139.jpg"                      border="0"                >The BootIt Collection covers multi-booting, partitioning, and disk imaging on traditional PC’s using the standard BIOS and  newer PC’s using UEFI.   The collection includes BootIt Bare Metal (BIBM) for standard BIOS systems and BootIt UEFI (BIU) for UEFI system.<br></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><ul><li>You will see a window pop-up on the Zoom app. It will show waiting for the Zoom meeting to be started by the host.</li><li>At this point, you will notice a window pop-up asking you to provide access to the camera along with the microphone on your device.

Click on it so you can provide a permit to Zoom to access the microphone and camera of the device you are using.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/schedule-zoom-meeting-android-3.jpg"                      alt="zoom access permission android"                ></p><ul><li>Now, you will see a window pop-up asking you to provide access to Zoom to record a video or click a picture. Click on the button “<strong>Allow</strong>“</li><li>Now, at this point, the screen of your device will have the option “<strong>Participants,</strong>“.

Here, after this, you will see a menu. This menu will have a few options you can choose from so you can send guest invites. Also, using Zoom’s contacts option, you may invite people by sending an email or sharing the invite link, and so on.

It’s a chance to express yourself, a platform to share your ideas and thoughts with people. Also, to show people who you are and what you’re about—the beauty of solo podcasting. You are free, and it’s a great feeling. The idea is simple: You are the protagonist of your own story.</p><h3 id="Go-at-your-own-pace"><a href="#Go-at-your-own-pace" class="headerlink" title="Go at your own pace"></a>Go at your own pace</h3><p>Working on your own gives flexibility with working hours you wouldn’t get as part of a team. That means you can work at your own pace and not feel pressured by a deadline or fear failing since knowing no one but yourself is listening.</p><p>It also means you can work at your own pace as a podcast host without waiting for your audience to be ready.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.massmailsoftware.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=2069351&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/dc87c13749315c7217cdc4ac692e704c/banera_for_partners-24_%282%29.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Content-is-totally-under-your-control"><a href="#Content-is-totally-under-your-control" class="headerlink" title="Content is totally under your control"></a>Content is totally under your control</h3><p>You’re always controlling your content while working in a solo podcaster scenario. No one else tells you what to say; no one tells you how to say it.</p><p>The upside is that you don’t have to worry about getting your ideas “out there,” which allows you to be creative.No but yourself can dictate the tone of your show.</p><p>Solo podcasters don’t have anyone else to compete with, and they get to choose what they talk about. You’re in full control over everything, which means no advertisers or sponsors are dictating your message.</p><p>That means you can ensure that you deliver a compelling story that people want to hear.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2084399/18498" target="_top" id="2084399"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2084399"                      border="0" alt="" width="1125" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2084399/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Post-Production-is-Easier"><a href="#Post-Production-is-Easier" class="headerlink" title="Post-Production is Easier"></a>Post-Production is Easier</h3><p>When you work alone, you can take time to make changes or re-edits.

So you’ll likely struggle to connect with them on a personal level. But By developing a solo podcast, you allow yourself to develop a personal brand while building a network of people who share your same passion and interests.</p><p>Keep your content focused on your unique story, and be as transparent as possible when you get started. Most listeners prefer to connect with the hosts they find on podcasts than on other media, And Solo Podcast listeners trust their hosts as experts on their topics.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Make-a-Bang-Up-Solo-Podcast"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Make-a-Bang-Up-Solo-Podcast" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

It helps you understand the topic you want to cover.</p><p>If you don’t have a clear idea of what you want to talk about, you will have trouble following along when you sit down to record. Just be careful not to repeat yourself too much. Don’t try and cover every single aspect of your topic.</p><h3 id="A-hook-for-the-episode-beginning"><a href="#A-hook-for-the-episode-beginning" class="headerlink" title="A hook for the episode beginning"></a>A hook for the episode beginning</h3><p>The hook is the first thing that draws the listener in and sets up the rest of the content. What is it about your show that makes people want to listen? Your hook should always be unique, but a little commonality doesn’t hurt.</p><p>If you’re struggling to come up with a hook for an episode of your podcast, here are a few ideas for you to consider:</p><ul><li>What topic do you enjoy talking about?</li><li>What do you want to learn about?</li><li>Is there something, in particular, you’re interested in?</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://newchic.sjv.io/c/5597632/1659704/14420" target="_top" id="1659704"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14420-1659704"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1659704/14420"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Mind-the-length-of-your-solo-podcast"><a href="#Mind-the-length-of-your-solo-podcast" class="headerlink" title="Mind the length of your solo podcast"></a>Mind the length of your solo podcast</h3><p>Length is everything. Podcasting is about the length of your content, and you will struggle if you have a short episode. You need at least 30 minutes of material for your episode, or you risk alienating listeners and driving them away from your brand.</p><p>You’ll lose listeners’ attention if you don’t know what to say during your episode. So instead, think of your podcast as a mini-publication. You can get away with making shorter episodes because you can fill more content into your episodes.</p><h3 id="Recap-the-episode"><a href="#Recap-the-episode" class="headerlink" title="Recap the episode"></a>Recap the episode</h3><p>Recapping the previous episode is a great way to start your podcast. Doing so allows your listeners to quickly catch up while at the same time giving you a chance to share the most relevant information from the last show.</p><p>That way, when the next podcast episode starts, your listeners will already be up-to-date on essential information.</p><h3 id="The-right-tool-for-recording-and-editing"><a href="#The-right-tool-for-recording-and-editing" class="headerlink" title="The right tool for recording and editing"></a>The right tool for recording and editing</h3><p>As the popularity of podcasts continues to grow, so does the need for quality, professional sound recordings and editing tools.</p><p>If you’re a podcaster looking to record and edit, Wondershare Filmora must be your priority.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><strong>Wondershare Filmora</strong></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/solo-podcasting-4.jpg"                      alt="wondershare filmora"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://turbotech.pxf.io/c/5597632/1450763/17212" target="_top" id="1450763"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17212-1450763"                      border="0" alt="" width="2560" height="1440"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1450763/17212"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>For those who would like to produce podcasts or videos on the go, Wondershare Filmora is not only an easy-to-use video editing software but also a good helper for podcast editing.</p><ul><li>Speech-to-text allows smooth conversion of voiceover to text, making your podcasts more accessible.</li><li>Over 2000+ audio resources range from music, audio effects and much more.</li><li>Remove background noise, fade in, fade out, and do lots more audio editing without hassles.</li><li>Supports many shortcut key commands to help tech-savvy and non-tec-savvy individuals to create and edit podcasts quickly.</li><li>Audio Ducking to easily eliminate background noise and unwanted sound recorded while creating podcasts.</li></ul><p>You can export your episodes as MP3 files, which can then be uploaded to any podcast hosting site like iTunes, Podomatic, and Libsyn.

You don’t need to be perfect from the very beginning.</p><h3 id="Practice"><a href="#Practice" class="headerlink" title="Practice"></a>Practice</h3><p>It takes some practice to get the natural flow of conversation going.

There are 2 ways of creating time-lapse videos with GoPro:</p><ol><li>Record a still photo sequence on your action camera and then compile it later on your computer.</li><li>Leave the task of compiling to your action camera to get an MP4 video.</li></ol><p>The in-camera version, also known as the time lapse video mode, is present only in GoPro Hero4 and Hero5 series. For other GoPro models, it is necessary to use a software to compile images and video clips. The GoPro Studio, which developed by GoPro, is an ideal video editing software which allows you to create nicely edited time-lapse videos. In this article, we will show you how to create a time lapse video with images and clips in GoPro Studio.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Create Timelapse videos from Videos</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Create Timelapse videos from Images</a></li></ul><h2 id="Create-GoPro-Studio-Time-Lapse-Videos-from-Images"><a href="#Create-GoPro-Studio-Time-Lapse-Videos-from-Images" class="headerlink" title="Create GoPro Studio Time Lapse Videos from Images"></a>Create GoPro Studio Time Lapse Videos from Images</h2><h4 id="1-Import-Images"><a href="#1-Import-Images" class="headerlink" title="1. Import Images"></a><strong>1. Import Images</strong></h4><p>The first thing you have to do is import your images. This can be done by clicking File &gt; Import Media or click Import New Files on the left panel. Ideally you need to keep all your photos in a single folder and name them according to sequence. This would instantly pick up the image sequence when you click on the first file. Then the software will create a reference video automatically, which may take a couple of seconds.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Learn How to shoot a time-lapse video with GoPro Hero5 Black <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-gopro-studio.jpg"                      alt="GoPro Studio Import"                ></p><h4 id="2-Select-the-Clips"><a href="#2-Select-the-Clips" class="headerlink" title="2. Select the Clips"></a><strong>2. Select the Clips</strong></h4><p>The reference video would be imported by GoPro Studio. Go to Import New Files and click the video to add it to the central window. When you click the Play button, you can watch the time-lapse played at approximately 30 fps. In the left hand corner of the bottom you can see the Advanced Setting button. By adjusting these settings you will be able to select your desired frame rate. There are also other options like Quality setting, Motion Blur and the Speedup option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/advanced-settings-gopro-studio.jpg"                      alt="GoPro Studio Advanced Settings"                ></p><h4 id="3-Convert"><a href="#3-Convert" class="headerlink" title="3. Convert"></a><strong>3. Convert</strong></h4><p>The clip is automatically queued at the conversion list. While adding more than one clip just repeat the process to add them to your conversion list panel. Now you just need to click the convert button, and all the sequences would be converted into a ready-to-edit video file. It might take some time depending on how many clips you have. You will see a preview in a tiny thumbnail while it’s processing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-video-with-gopro-studio-4.jpg"                      alt="GoPro Studio Conversion"                ></p><h4 id="4-Edit"><a href="#4-Edit" class="headerlink" title="4. Edit"></a><strong>4. Edit</strong></h4><p>Once the conversion is done, you need to click on Proceed to Next Stage which would take you to the edit panel. Now drag the videos from the media window and place them on the timeline just under the centre window. The video can be edited here and the speed can be altered in the right hand window by unfolding the video and dragging the speed slider. The framing can also be altered so that you can select how much of the image you want to show.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-interface-gopro-studio.jpg"                      alt="GoPro Studio Edit Interface"                ></p><h4 id="5-Export"><a href="#5-Export" class="headerlink" title="5. Export"></a><strong>5. Export</strong></h4><p>If you are trying to find the easiest way to export a basic time-lapse footage then you can do away with the storyboard panel. If the basic settings don’t bother you, then just click the Export button. A new browser window would open, where you can name the file to be exported and select the location where you want to save. You can even select the setting at which you want it exported. You will find optimized settings for Vimeo and YouTube, and you can even do the setting individually by going to the Custom option.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Learn more in Complete Guide to Edit a Video with GoPro Studio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Create-GoPro-timelapse-video-from-Video-Clips"><a href="#Create-GoPro-timelapse-video-from-Video-Clips" class="headerlink" title="Create GoPro timelapse video from Video Clips"></a>Create GoPro timelapse video from Video Clips</h2><p>You can also choose to make a time-lapse video with the help of the video clips shot on your action camera.</p><p>After importing and converting your videos, go to the Edit section and drag the speed slider under the Video menu on the right hand panel. Generally 100% is the normal speed but you can always increase the number for a higher speed.</p><p>However, importing your video clips to GoPro Studio is a rather time taking process which is going to test your patience. So, we recommend you the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> software. With Filmora, you will be able to import a video as large as 8GB in just 2 minutes, and the trim and merge feature would allow you to use certain specific frames without any loss in quality. The Filmora editing software would also allow you to speed up the video clips, so that you can speed up the trimmed no quality loss clips to make a wonderful time lapse video.</p><p><img

When you post your own unique brand of wit and humor in the form of memes, remember to do the same for other people. With the help of this article, you can quickly and effortlessly transform a memorable occasion into a meme that will spread like wildfire.</p><p>Let’s start off!</p><h2 id="1-What-exactly-is-a-meme"><a href="#1-What-exactly-is-a-meme" class="headerlink" title="1. What exactly is a meme?"></a>1. What exactly is a meme?</h2><p>A meme is an image that is passed around online and is accompanied by some form of writing. These memes typically offer sharp criticism on cultural icons, societal concepts, or current events. A meme is often an image or a video, although it can also take the form of a string of words in some cases. When a meme strikes a chord with a large number of people, it begins to circulate through various social platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, messaging, and other methods. The more the number of times a meme is shared, the more of an impact it has on culture.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/grandpa-meme-image.jpg"                      alt="grandpa meme image"                ></p><h2 id="2-When-did-memes-become-a-thing-online"><a href="#2-When-did-memes-become-a-thing-online" class="headerlink" title="2. When did memes become a thing online?"></a>2. When did memes become a thing online?</h2><p>Memes, which originated as an idea conceived from an improbable source, have emerged as one of the key modes of communication that are used on the internet. Memes have almost completely taken over popular culture, and they can be found just about anywhere. Your favorite artist, a member of your family, or even a politician may be the one who spreads them. Anything, even humans, has the potential to spread virally and turn into a meme. If you get extremely lucky, becoming a meme can even make you famous.</p><p>At one point in time, many believed that memes were nothing more than strange visuals that certain portions of the internet created for their own amusement. They are now an integral element of the typical engagement that takes place on social media and are utilized, shared, and consumed on a minute-to-minute basis. They can take something as harmless as the children’s show Arthur and turn the visuals into something that causes the authors of the series to issue an apology, or they can make fun of the very idea of possessing a certain guitar model.</p><p>People’s lives are becoming increasingly influenced by the internet and various forms of social media, which has coincided with the proliferation of memes in popular culture. Memes have evolved into the ideal medium for disseminating knowledge, comedic content, and political viewpoints as the amount of time spent online continues to rise. Memes have evolved from simple image changes made with the intention of making people laugh into rhetorical devices that are capable of spreading information to millions of people. As a result, memes have established themselves as one of the most important mediums in today’s society. This is how the meme has progressed over time.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/create-an-online-meme.jpg"                      alt="create an online meme"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://zonlipartnershipprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/1821134/17882" target="_top" id="1821134"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17882-1821134"                      border="0" alt="" width="320" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1821134/17882"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-How-do-you-make-a-meme"><a href="#3-How-do-you-make-a-meme" class="headerlink" title="3.

All you need is a good picture of something, or someone expressing an emotion such a confusion, happiness, and think of a funny phrase people can relate to.</p><p>Step1 When you set out to create a meme, you should typically do so with an idea in mind. But if that’s not possible, try to come up with a hilarious response.</p><p>Step2 Launch Filmora, then important the photo, and after that, choose the font you want to use.

You don’t want to rely on methods that have since become obsolete. Do some research to find out what’s trending by looking through old memes. Also, pay attention to the memes that other people are posting wherever it is on the internet that you spend the majority of your time. It doesn’t matter if it’s Reddit, Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter.</p><p>Try to locate recent memes by browsing subreddits such as r&#x2F;memes and r&#x2F;dankmemes. In addition, there are times when a particular category of meme becomes popular. In that case, you should give those memes a shot and see if you can make them. For instance, Bernie Sanders was a topic of conversation for a few days not too long ago.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://purchase.swifdoo.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=40002580&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/8b932759a5a04ddb34bf79e3f9072e4b/products/3_Product%20box%20white-1024x1024.png"                      border="0"                >SwifDoo PDF 2-Year Plan</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="5-Share-your-meme"><a href="#5-Share-your-meme" class="headerlink" title="5.

To review, you are now familiar with the process of creating a meme by either using a meme template that is blank so that you may add new meme captions or by making use of a screenshot tool to generate an entirely new meme.</p><p>If neither of these techniques works for you, another option is to use image editing software to generate new memes by uploading your own images or creating new memes from existing ones. When it comes to creating and distributing your very own memes, the number of options that are available to you is virtually limitless. Also, who knows, maybe you’ll come up with the next meme that becomes popular!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/share-your-meme-image.jpg"                      alt="share your meme image"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://vapordna.pxf.io/c/5597632/1496243/17238" target="_top" id="1496243"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17238-1496243"                      border="0" alt="" width="1000" height="1221"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1496243/17238"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.manycam.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=17729331&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/8230bea7d54bcdf99cdfe85cb07313d5/mcaffbanner600x500.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>And that’s it!

They contacted content creator to offer collaboration, in exchange you need to run their video in one of your vlogs and they will pay you for that. The fee is depended on the agreement of both parties. Sometime they offer a high price to your expectation, but there is a contract for how many months will their video ads must be posted on your video.</p><p>In this article, let’s talk about how much companies pay for video ads in a Vlogger’s video, what are the types of promo videos? and what are the tools needed to create or enhance your promotional videos.</p><ol><li><a href="#part2-1">Product demo videos</a></li><li><a href="#part2-2">Event videos</a></li><li><a href="#part2-3">Explainer videos</a></li><li><a href="#part2-4">Product Review video</a></li><li><a href="#part2-5">Testimonial videos</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part3">How much does it cost to make a promo video</a></li><li><a href="#part4">How long should a promotional video be</a></li><li><a href="#part5">You’re going to need video editing tools to:</a></li></ul><h2 id="What-is-Promotional-Video"><a href="#What-is-Promotional-Video" class="headerlink" title="What is Promotional Video?"></a>What is Promotional Video?</h2><p>A promotional or promo video is a short video that promotes a company’s product or service.

If your viewers are new to your brand or channel a promo video can introduce to your channel.</p><p>Think about all the advertisements you see during the lead up to holiday weekends from big brands promoting their town promotions. or teaser trailers that perfectly capture the mood of a film and go viral, even with very little information about the actual plot.</p><p>Compared to text-based flyers, articles or posters, promotional videos allow you to tell as well as shown the product you offer in an engaging manner.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/promotion-video-example.jpg"                      alt="promotion video example"                ></p><h2 id="Types-of-Promo-Videos"><a href="#Types-of-Promo-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Types of Promo Videos"></a>Types of Promo Videos</h2><p>When it comes to the kinds of promo videos you can create, you have a world of options.</p><h3 id="Product-demo-videos"><a href="#Product-demo-videos" class="headerlink" title="Product demo videos"></a>Product demo videos</h3><p>A product demo video shows users how they will go through the process using the entire product or some of its core features. it gives your potential customers an opportunity to see your product used in everyday life, which ultimately leads to conversion.

This range is quite large, but the high-end accounts for sophisticated professional equipment meant for video veterans and full production teams.</p><p>That may have been a requirement in the past. however, today you don’t need a fancy video production team that makes you wait weeks while paying thousands of dollars.</p><p>Another way of promotion is that there are company asking content creator to include a video ads on their vlogs. As to my experience, cost and fee for the promotional video, depend on what you have been discuss with the company. Sometimes the company itself offers the price, but of course that also depends on the status of you channel. The company also doesn’t want to spent on promotion if it doesn’t get any positive output or good sales.</p><h2 id="How-long-should-a-promotional-video-be"><a href="#How-long-should-a-promotional-video-be" class="headerlink" title="How long should a promotional video be?"></a>How long should a promotional video be?</h2><p>Try to keep it under 2-minutes and make sure you’re hitting the important information and should also be true here. that said, promo videos do tend to go a little deeper than your typical video ad so take the opportunity to showcase your brand and really convey valuable information to audience.</p><p>As for video ads, advice is to stick to 15 to 20 seconds if you’re using pre-roll ads or six seconds for what are known as bumper ads, which are intended for brand awareness.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://estore.winxdvd.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=12653853&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/bcb41ccdc4363c6848a1d760f26c28a0/products/14_videoproc-converter-ai-box.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="You’re-going-to-need-video-editing-tools-to"><a href="#You’re-going-to-need-video-editing-tools-to" class="headerlink" title="You’re going to need video editing tools to"></a>You’re going to need video editing tools to</h2><p>Things to consider during the process knowing which types of elements you want to add to your video is vital. for example, you might have to add audio to video that adds value to your promo efforts, knowing that text and subtitles are important to reaching a wider audience.</p><p>I’d recommend you to pick an online video editor software that is user friendly or easy to use software so you will not having a hard time to edit your videos.

Promotional videos aren’t all about your products advertisement and push prospects to by them. In making promotional video should be clearly discussed and the cost or fee is always depending on the Brand owner and your rate. Also don’t forget to carefully read the contract that the company will give you to sign for the service you will do for them. When you accept this kind of work, you should always think about the welfare of your name and channel, not that you just accept it even if it is not approved to your preference, but it just only because of the money.

If your viewers are new to your brand or channel a promo video can introduce to your channel.</p><p>Think about all the advertisements you see during the lead up to holiday weekends from big brands promoting their town promotions. or teaser trailers that perfectly capture the mood of a film and go viral, even with very little information about the actual plot.</p><p>Compared to text-based flyers, articles or posters, promotional videos allow you to tell as well as shown the product you offer in an engaging manner.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/promotion-video-example.jpg"                      alt="promotion video example"                ></p><h2 id="Types-of-Promo-Videos-1"><a href="#Types-of-Promo-Videos-1" class="headerlink" title="Types of Promo Videos"></a>Types of Promo Videos</h2><p>When it comes to the kinds of promo videos you can create, you have a world of options.</p><h3 id="Product-demo-videos-1"><a href="#Product-demo-videos-1" class="headerlink" title="Product demo videos"></a>Product demo videos</h3><p>A product demo video shows users how they will go through the process using the entire product or some of its core features. it gives your potential customers an opportunity to see your product used in everyday life, which ultimately leads to conversion.

This range is quite large, but the high-end accounts for sophisticated professional equipment meant for video veterans and full production teams.</p><p>That may have been a requirement in the past. however, today you don’t need a fancy video production team that makes you wait weeks while paying thousands of dollars.</p><p>Another way of promotion is that there are company asking content creator to include a video ads on their vlogs. As to my experience, cost and fee for the promotional video, depend on what you have been discuss with the company. Sometimes the company itself offers the price, but of course that also depends on the status of you channel. The company also doesn’t want to spent on promotion if it doesn’t get any positive output or good sales.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ukaidot.sjv.io/c/5597632/1793237/19578" target="_top" id="1793237"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19578-1793237"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="1200"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1793237/19578"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-long-should-a-promotional-video-be-1"><a href="#How-long-should-a-promotional-video-be-1" class="headerlink" title="How long should a promotional video be?"></a>How long should a promotional video be?</h2><p>Try to keep it under 2-minutes and make sure you’re hitting the important information and should also be true here. that said, promo videos do tend to go a little deeper than your typical video ad so take the opportunity to showcase your brand and really convey valuable information to audience.</p><p>As for video ads, advice is to stick to 15 to 20 seconds if you’re using pre-roll ads or six seconds for what are known as bumper ads, which are intended for brand awareness.</p><h2 id="You’re-going-to-need-video-editing-tools-to-1"><a href="#You’re-going-to-need-video-editing-tools-to-1" class="headerlink" title="You’re going to need video editing tools to"></a>You’re going to need video editing tools to</h2><p>Things to consider during the process knowing which types of elements you want to add to your video is vital. for example, you might have to add audio to video that adds value to your promo efforts, knowing that text and subtitles are important to reaching a wider audience.</p><p>I’d recommend you to pick an online video editor software that is user friendly or easy to use software so you will not having a hard time to edit your videos.

Promotional videos aren’t all about your products advertisement and push prospects to by them. In making promotional video should be clearly discussed and the cost or fee is always depending on the Brand owner and your rate. Also don’t forget to carefully read the contract that the company will give you to sign for the service you will do for them. When you accept this kind of work, you should always think about the welfare of your name and channel, not that you just accept it even if it is not approved to your preference, but it just only because of the money. Always remember that it’s not always money that will make you successful but the talent and honesty at work.</p><p>That’s been a quick guide on promotional videos.

Tips for Webinar Titles"></a>Part 2. Tips for Webinar Titles</h2><p>While stating the obvious in your headlines is preferable, this does not imply that your titles must be uninteresting. A catchy adjective might make your content stand out on social media or in search results among other comparable pieces. To beat out the competition for your webinars, use these suggestions.</p><p><strong>Incorporate a keyword</strong> <strong>:</strong> Make sure to include a good keyword at the beginning of your title. It will make it apparent to viewers what your webinar is about, which might raise its search engine ranking and enhance its exposure on social media. Prior to speaking with a member of your sales staff, think about the knowledge you want your customers to have.</p><p><strong>Keep it brief and to the point:</strong> There’s a danger your message - and your audience - may be lost if you start to make titles that are too lengthy. The most frequent and large volume of traffic is attracted by titles with 6 to 13 words. This is also true of effective webinar titles. Even if there may be a little more room for length, extensive titles won’t draw in visitors.</p><p><strong>Test out enticing webinar names:</strong> There is no set formula for writing intriguing webinar titles. This may seem easy, but coming up with intriguing webinar names may be difficult! You may write concise and compelling webinar names with the use of descriptive language. Use strong emotive language that is provocative. By using a few brief calls to action, like “CTA,” in the title of your webinar, you may quickly attract attention. In this case, capitalization may be beneficial.</p><p><strong>Relevance:</strong> People are more inclined to sign up for activities that are specifically designed for them. Your webinar’s title ought to allude to both the subject you’ll be covering and the target audience you want to reach. Would you want to attract marketers? Or maybe your target audience is retail customers? Make sure your title both conveys the subject and is relevant to them.</p><p><strong>Display the benefits of your webinar:</strong> The simplest webinar names are often the best. People are curious about how they will spend their time. You may encourage people to sign up for your webinar by making it clear in the title what benefits they will get. If your audience is seeking information and the subject is interesting to them, they will probably click to learn more. Making sure that the names of your webinars are obvious might be quite rewarding.</p><p><strong>Make the target audience the title of your webinar:</strong> Use the name of your target audience as another clever but straightforward approach for selecting the ideal webinar names. Since you would first get their attention in this scenario, using such a goal will be of great assistance to you. You could wish to do it by using the name of a group of professionals or locals.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4620778&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/07dd4d5a72f5740ef0f035f201951476/300__250banner.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Are you having trouble coming up with a title for your most recent webinar?

Tips for Webinar Titles"></a>Part 2. Tips for Webinar Titles</h2><p>While stating the obvious in your headlines is preferable, this does not imply that your titles must be uninteresting. A catchy adjective might make your content stand out on social media or in search results among other comparable pieces. To beat out the competition for your webinars, use these suggestions.</p><p><strong>Incorporate a keyword</strong> <strong>:</strong> Make sure to include a good keyword at the beginning of your title. It will make it apparent to viewers what your webinar is about, which might raise its search engine ranking and enhance its exposure on social media. Prior to speaking with a member of your sales staff, think about the knowledge you want your customers to have.</p><p><strong>Keep it brief and to the point:</strong> There’s a danger your message - and your audience - may be lost if you start to make titles that are too lengthy. The most frequent and large volume of traffic is attracted by titles with 6 to 13 words. This is also true of effective webinar titles. Even if there may be a little more room for length, extensive titles won’t draw in visitors.</p><p><strong>Test out enticing webinar names:</strong> There is no set formula for writing intriguing webinar titles. This may seem easy, but coming up with intriguing webinar names may be difficult! You may write concise and compelling webinar names with the use of descriptive language. Use strong emotive language that is provocative. By using a few brief calls to action, like “CTA,” in the title of your webinar, you may quickly attract attention. In this case, capitalization may be beneficial.</p><p><strong>Relevance:</strong> People are more inclined to sign up for activities that are specifically designed for them. Your webinar’s title ought to allude to both the subject you’ll be covering and the target audience you want to reach. Would you want to attract marketers? Or maybe your target audience is retail customers? Make sure your title both conveys the subject and is relevant to them.</p><p><strong>Display the benefits of your webinar:</strong> The simplest webinar names are often the best. People are curious about how they will spend their time. You may encourage people to sign up for your webinar by making it clear in the title what benefits they will get. If your audience is seeking information and the subject is interesting to them, they will probably click to learn more. Making sure that the names of your webinars are obvious might be quite rewarding.</p><p><strong>Make the target audience the title of your webinar:</strong> Use the name of your target audience as another clever but straightforward approach for selecting the ideal webinar names. Since you would first get their attention in this scenario, using such a goal will be of great assistance to you. You could wish to do it by using the name of a group of professionals or locals.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Are you having trouble coming up with a title for your most recent webinar? There are always choices available here. With any luck, this post will serve as a springboard for a successful and lengthy career as a webinar title writer. Evidently, there isn’t a one successful webinar title for every firm. It takes time and effort to have your webinar titles working for you. Consider a ton of ideas, test them, and decide which ones work best for your own webinars. Keep it a closely-kept secret after that.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-elevate-your-videos-the-basics-of-stunning-slow-motion-capturing-in-android/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Elevate Your Videos  The Basics of Stunning Slow Motion Capturing in Android</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-how-to-preview-off-facebook-activities-and-should-i-leave-it-on-check/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  How to Preview Off-Facebook Activities and Should I Leave It On?

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Perfecting-Crossfades-Sweeps-in-Premiere"><a href="#Perfecting-Crossfades-Sweeps-in-Premiere" class="headerlink" title="Perfecting Crossfades &amp; Sweeps in Premiere"></a>Perfecting Crossfades &amp; Sweeps in Premiere</h2><p>When a slide or clip is replaced by another, transition effects are shown. When editing video, there is a transition between every edit or cut. The easiest audio transitions in Premiere Pro are when you switch directly from one scene to the next. This enables a seamless changeover between scenes for the editor. To tie the scenes together and make the change from one scene to the next seem seamless, it usually happens gradually. The transition that seasoned videographers utilize most often is this one.</p><p>A scene or speech transition in which the audio gradually (or abruptly) lowers in volume are known as an audio fade out. If you want to know about how to crossfade audio in premiere pro, then we’ve got you covered. It is a common sort of transition that may be used to soften a transition between two clips or to smooth out a cut. However, switching between clips without any extra special effects might sometimes seem difficult to viewers. Follow the steps below to cross fade audio in Premiere Pro.</p><ol><li><a href="#part1-1">Constant Gain</a></li><li><a href="#part1-2">Constant Power</a></li><li><a href="#part1-3">Exponential Fade</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part2">How to Crossfade Audio in Premiere Pro</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Alternative way to add audio transitions in videos</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-Types-of-Audio-Transitions-in-Premiere-Pro"><a href="#Part-1-Types-of-Audio-Transitions-in-Premiere-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Types of Audio Transitions in Premiere Pro"></a>Part 1. Types of Audio Transitions in Premiere Pro</h2><p>Let’s briefly take a look at the most popular audio transitions in Premiere Pro before going through the step-by-step tutorial on making an audio fade out. The audio fade is essentially a visual transition. Crossfading describes the audible transition between two audio samples on the same track. The terms “fade-in” and “fade-out” refer to the two different kinds of crossfade transitions, and Premiere Pro offers its customers three different crossfade effects: constant gain, constant power, and exponential fade. Following are some specifics:</p><h3 id="Constant-Gain"><a href="#Constant-Gain" class="headerlink" title="Constant Gain"></a>Constant Gain</h3><p>When switching between scenes, audio is constantly increased or decreased. The audio frequently sounds abrupt during this crossfade. Constant gain crossfade is a kind of audio transition where the audio is consistently increased or decreased as you switch between clips. Additionally, it lacks the exponential fade’s smoothness. Don’t ignore it however; it does have its uses. You’ll probably use this sparingly.</p><h3 id="Constant-Power"><a href="#Constant-Power" class="headerlink" title="Constant Power"></a>Constant Power</h3><p>In Premiere, the fade that dilutes the audio volume fluctuations between clips is represented by Constant Power. The second clip begins with a rapid spike and then decelerates at the conclusion of the transition. It produces a fluid, cinematic sequence that is understated yet high in quality. ideal for your next movie.</p><p>It is used to gradually reduce audio for the first clip at start, then swiftly when the transition comes to a close. It works by gradually speeding up at the conclusion of the transition before gradually reducing the audio for your initial clip. This crossfades raises audio in the second clip swiftly at initially and then more gradually at the conclusion of the transition.</p><h3 id="Exponential-Fade"><a href="#Exponential-Fade" class="headerlink" title="Exponential Fade"></a>Exponential Fade</h3><p>This crossfade operates in an exponential manner, beginning slowly before accelerating till the conclusion of the clip, giving the impression of a moving curve. An audio transition known as an exponential fade begins off slowly before gradually lowering or raising the level until it is finished. It works well for sequences with dialogue switches or for the conclusion. Without the abrupt flip, it provides a considerably shorter fade out that ends fast yet gracefully. Perfect for switching scenes with various atmospheres or for conversation.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Crossfade-Audio-in-Premiere-Pro"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Crossfade-Audio-in-Premiere-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to Crossfade Audio in Premiere Pro"></a>Part 2. How to Crossfade Audio in Premiere Pro</h2><p>All you have to do is adhere to the instructions below to fade out your audio in Premiere. Here are a few useful techniques for crossfading audio in Premiere Pro.</p><p><strong>Steps To Crossfade Audio in PR:</strong></p><h5 id="Step1-Download-and-Install-Premiere-Pro"><a href="#Step1-Download-and-Install-Premiere-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Download and Install Premiere Pro"></a>Step1 Download and Install Premiere Pro</h5><p>On your computer, download and install Premiere Pro. You would then be able to import your audio file into Premiere Pro once you’ve launched it.

Types of Audio Transitions in Premiere Pro"></a>Part 1. Types of Audio Transitions in Premiere Pro</h2><p>Let’s briefly take a look at the most popular audio transitions in Premiere Pro before going through the step-by-step tutorial on making an audio fade out. The audio fade is essentially a visual transition. Crossfading describes the audible transition between two audio samples on the same track. The terms “fade-in” and “fade-out” refer to the two different kinds of crossfade transitions, and Premiere Pro offers its customers three different crossfade effects: constant gain, constant power, and exponential fade. Following are some specifics:</p><h3 id="Constant-Gain-1"><a href="#Constant-Gain-1" class="headerlink" title="Constant Gain"></a>Constant Gain</h3><p>When switching between scenes, audio is constantly increased or decreased. The audio frequently sounds abrupt during this crossfade. Constant gain crossfade is a kind of audio transition where the audio is consistently increased or decreased as you switch between clips. Additionally, it lacks the exponential fade’s smoothness. Don’t ignore it however; it does have its uses. You’ll probably use this sparingly.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4531356&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/8fdd149fcaa7058caccc9c4ad5b0d89a/products/tss-box.JPG"                      border="0"                >The Tube Sites Submitter is a fast and efficient tool for anyone who needs to upload videos quickly, easily and automatically to hundreds of tube sites in mere minutes . </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Constant-Power-1"><a href="#Constant-Power-1" class="headerlink" title="Constant Power"></a>Constant Power</h3><p>In Premiere, the fade that dilutes the audio volume fluctuations between clips is represented by Constant Power. The second clip begins with a rapid spike and then decelerates at the conclusion of the transition. It produces a fluid, cinematic sequence that is understated yet high in quality. ideal for your next movie.</p><p>It is used to gradually reduce audio for the first clip at start, then swiftly when the transition comes to a close. It works by gradually speeding up at the conclusion of the transition before gradually reducing the audio for your initial clip. This crossfades raises audio in the second clip swiftly at initially and then more gradually at the conclusion of the transition.</p><h3 id="Exponential-Fade-1"><a href="#Exponential-Fade-1" class="headerlink" title="Exponential Fade"></a>Exponential Fade</h3><p>This crossfade operates in an exponential manner, beginning slowly before accelerating till the conclusion of the clip, giving the impression of a moving curve. An audio transition known as an exponential fade begins off slowly before gradually lowering or raising the level until it is finished. It works well for sequences with dialogue switches or for the conclusion. Without the abrupt flip, it provides a considerably shorter fade out that ends fast yet gracefully. Perfect for switching scenes with various atmospheres or for conversation.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://coinrule.sjv.io/c/5597632/1958379/18409" target="_top" id="1958379"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18409-1958379"                      border="0" alt="" width="856" height="508"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1958379/18409"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Crossfade-Audio-in-Premiere-Pro-1"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Crossfade-Audio-in-Premiere-Pro-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

So, to achieve so, click the Import button in this software’s default layout as seen below:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/get-started-with-filmora-03.png"                      alt="launch filmora and add files to timeline"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087394/7443" target="_top" id="2087394"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087394"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087394/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h5 id="Step2-Split-the-audio-track-for-Transition-1"><a href="#Step2-Split-the-audio-track-for-Transition-1" class="headerlink" title="Step2 Split the audio track for Transition"></a>Step2 Split the audio track for Transition</h5><p>You may now use the splitting audio approach to clip off the portions of your audio files where you wish to generate audio transitions, just as you did when you imported and moved your files about the timeline as described above. To accomplish it, choose the audio file, then click the Split icon at the timeline’s top as seen below:</p><p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> You may also split the audio by just moving the slider over the audio and pressing it exactly where you want the audio to be split from the other.</p><h5 id="Step3-Make-the-audio-transitions-1"><a href="#Step3-Make-the-audio-transitions-1" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Make the audio transitions"></a>Step3 Make the audio transitions</h5><p>We focus on how you would use the editing feature on your audio that was divided for transitional reasons in this stage. So, to use this option, choose the relevant track, right-click on it to bring up the audio file’s settings, and then choose Edit Audio.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/add-audio-fade-in-fade-out.jpg"                      alt="make the audio transitions"                ></p><p>In this main step, you’ll get to know the transitioning technique with the Filmora. To use, follow these instructions in the audio editor, which has just appeared on the right side of the program screen. You can simply create the audio transitions without any hassles by going to the Volume area of the audio editor from there and modifying the volume of the audio track that you had separated for this reason.</p><h5 id="Step4-Export-and-Share-the-File-1"><a href="#Step4-Export-and-Share-the-File-1" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Export and Share the File"></a>Step4 Export and Share the File</h5><p>The exporting procedure may now be completed in the last step with just a few clicks from the program interface by selecting the Export button in the top-right corner of your software screen as shown below:</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://natural-cycles.sjv.io/c/5597632/2072200/17885" target="_top" id="2072200"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17885-2072200"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2072200/17885"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>In a nutshell, it’s important to use the right program to customize the fade in&#x2F;out effect for your music. The best tool for post-production alterations and laborious procedures is Premiere. However, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is another program with a user-friendly interface and abundant media resources. Make sure you use the ideal toolbox for the job since the fading effect may make or break your project.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"
