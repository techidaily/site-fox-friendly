    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Integrating-Gentle-Decreases-Into-Your-Audience-Experience-via-Audacity"><a href="#Integrating-Gentle-Decreases-Into-Your-Audience-Experience-via-Audacity" class="headerlink" title="Integrating Gentle Decreases Into Your Audience Experience via Audacity"></a>Integrating Gentle Decreases Into Your Audience Experience via Audacity</h2><p>Free, open-source freeware for Windows and Mac, Audacity, is a powerful toolkit to Fade Audacity. You could wish to employ the common music production method of fading songs in and out of your podcast using Audacity fade. To make an engaging and deeper podcast, it’s helpful to understand how to slightly fade out the music so that it plays in the background but still makes it easy to hear the spoken track. There are a few ways to do this.</p><p>You can easily apply professional fades to your audio files with Audacity fade out effect. The audio in the chosen portion will progressively get quieter when the fade out effect is applied, ending in stillness. The fade out tool is nearly totally automated, making it simple and understandable for both novices and experts. Along with the other several tools under Audacity’s Effects menu, the fade out tool may be found there.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Linear-Fade-in-out"><a href="#Part-1-Linear-Fade-in-out" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Linear Fade in&#x2F;out"></a>Part 1. Linear Fade in&#x2F;out</h2><p>You may apply linear fades, a straightforward fade option, to any segment of your music. Alternatively, you might apply it to the full audio file. Linear fades come in two varieties. Fade-in and Fade-out are the two varieties. Any section of your audio that you apply a fade-in to will get muted and return to its original volume. Additionally, if you activate the fade-out feature in your audio, the audio will transition from its original volume to total quiet.</p><h3 id="Steps-to-Use-Linear-Fade-in-out"><a href="#Steps-to-Use-Linear-Fade-in-out" class="headerlink" title="Steps to Use Linear Fade in&#x2F;out:"></a><strong>Steps to Use Linear Fade in&#x2F;out:</strong></h3><p>To divide a track into several parts so you may apply a fade to a specific audio segment, press Cmd + I (or Ctrl + I).</p><p>In this example, we divided the clip at the eight-second mark and used the Time Shift tool to shift the second chunk to the new location.</p><p>By selecting the audio segment, you wish to fade out and selecting Effect &gt; Fade Out, you may add a fade-out to the initial clip.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/liner-fade-in-audacity.jpg"                      alt="liner fade in audacity"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Studio-Fade-Out"><a href="#Part-2-Studio-Fade-Out" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Studio Fade Out"></a>Part 2. Studio Fade Out</h2><p>This effect is shown by Audacity as a curve that resembles the letter S. It results in a very gentle fading. After the first boom, there is utter quiet. It’s a sound that actually gives off the impression of fading away over time. Using the repeat last effect, you can quickly repeat this fading option. Additionally, Ctrl + R serves as the shortcut for the same.</p><h3 id="How-to-Use-Studio-Fade-Out"><a href="#How-to-Use-Studio-Fade-Out" class="headerlink" title="How to Use Studio Fade Out:"></a><strong>How to Use Studio Fade Out:</strong></h3><p>Choose your audio segment, go to the Effect menu, slide to the bottom, and pick Studio Fade Out to apply the effect.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/studio-fade-out-audacity.jpg"                      alt="studio fade out audacity"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Adjustable-Fade"><a href="#Part-3-Adjustable-Fade" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Adjustable Fade"></a>Part 3. Adjustable Fade</h2><p>A dialog box will show up on the screen when you choose the customizable fade option. You may customize the form and pattern of the fading using that dialog box. You may use this ability to make partial fades if you’d like. You must maintain the tracks stacked one on top of the other with the lower track underneath the higher track and its end overlapping when employing this form of fade.</p><h3 id="Steps-to-Use-Adjustable-Fade"><a href="#Steps-to-Use-Adjustable-Fade" class="headerlink" title="Steps to Use Adjustable Fade:"></a><strong>Steps to Use Adjustable Fade:</strong></h3><ul><li>Select Effect from the menu.</li><li>Select the variable fading option.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/adjustable-fade-audio-audacity.jpg"                      alt="adjustable fade audio audacity"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Crossfades-Audacity"><a href="#Part-4-Crossfades-Audacity" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. Crossfades Audacity"></a>Part 4. Crossfades Audacity</h2><p>There are two choices available when using this effect. You have two options: either manually make a crossfade of your own, or utilize one of the pre-existing crossfades in Audacity. In Audacity, there are two crossfades that are accessible. Crossfade clips and Crossfade tracks are what they are. Crossfade clips make it easier to switch between two distinct clips. Additionally, crossfade tracks aid in crossfading between two audio tracks and are more exact.</p><h3 id="Steps-to-Use-Crossfades"><a href="#Steps-to-Use-Crossfades" class="headerlink" title="Steps to Use Crossfades:"></a><strong>Steps to Use Crossfades:</strong></h3><p>Using the Time Shift Tool, place your two clips adjacent to one another in order to apply a crossfade across them on the same track.</p><p>Select the area to be crossfaded using the Selection tool, and then click Effect &gt; Crossfade Clips to combine the sounds you’ve chosen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/crossafade-audio-with-audacity.jpg"                      alt="crossafade audio with audacity"                ></p><p>Use your Selection tool to organize the clips such that a crossfade will be applied between two clips on different tracks. Go to Effect &gt; Crossfade Songs, place the cursor where you want the fade to begin, then drag it across the tracks you wish to blend.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Alternative-Way-to-Fade-Audio"><a href="#Part-5-Alternative-Way-to-Fade-Audio" class="headerlink" title="Part 5. Alternative Way to Fade Audio"></a>Part 5. Alternative Way to Fade Audio</h2><p>Even though it’s still thought of as difficult, time-consuming work, audio editing is really pretty easy with the correct program or tool. The quality of audio tracks in a video is often disregarded by amateur video producers. In addition to having advanced features like 4K editing support, GIF support, noise removal, color tuning, an advanced text editor, an audio mixer, video stabilization, scene detection, and an audio equalizer, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is fairly simple to use and allows for extensive customization of pre-existing templates.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><h5 id="Step1-Download-and-Install-Filmora"><a href="#Step1-Download-and-Install-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Download and Install Filmora"></a>Step1 Download and Install Filmora</h5><p>Installing Filmora, a straightforward platform for starting to edit your audio and music files, is the first step.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Premium-Quality-Computers-at-Your-Desk"><a href="#Premium-Quality-Computers-at-Your-Desk" class="headerlink" title="Premium Quality Computers at Your Desk"></a>Premium Quality Computers at Your Desk</h2><p>The designs of swanky, cutting-edge laptops are always changing. Smartphones are incredibly versatile and</p><p>widely used. Where does that leave the desktop PC, a relic of the 1980s? There are still a ton of options</p><p>available, and the desktop market is constantly innovating, particularly regarding all-in-one and small-</p><p>form-factor devices. But many customers appear to view desktop computers as an antique, since they</p><p>immediately walk to the laptop aisle when making their next computer purchase.</p><p>Let’s start off!</p><ol><li><a href="#part2-1">MSI MEG Aegis Ti5</a></li><li><a href="#part2-2">Corsair One i300</a></li><li><a href="#part2-3">Mac Mini (M1, 2020)</a></li><li><a href="#part2-4">Lenovo Yoga A940</a></li><li><a href="#part2-5">Azulle Access4</a></li><li><a href="#part2-6">Alienware Aurora R13</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part3">How much CPU power do you need</a></li><li><a href="#part4">What graphics card do you need</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-How-much-does-a-desktop-cost"><a href="#Part-1-How-much-does-a-desktop-cost" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. How much does a desktop cost?"></a>Part 1. How much does a desktop cost?</h2><p>The value the desktop offers are among its most attractive claims. With desktop PCs and their components,</p><p>your money just goes further. Instead of spending $600 on a laptop with a capable Intel Core i5 processor, you could spend the same amount of money on a desktop with a Core i7 CPU and perhaps even room for a</p><p>dedicated graphics card.</p><p>For very light labor and display-signage activities, entire micro-PCs are available for about $300, while perfectly functional small towers are available for between $300 and $600. Starting at about $600, gaming desktops with discrete graphics cards are available. All-in-one desktops, which include the display and all of the computer hardware in a single unit, are also available and start at about $450.</p><p>With desktops, you don’t run some of the same risks that you would with a laptop of comparable price. For</p><p>basic computing, a $250 Black Friday deal or a heavily discounted used desktop could work just fine, and you</p><p>wouldn’t have to worry about the cheap materials wearing out the way you could with a laptop of a comparable price. The whims of daily commuting and the sporadic drop from a coffee table would befall that</p><p>cheap laptop. However, the desktop would have to remain stationary and continue to function.</p><p>Business workstations, blinged-out gaming rigs, and exquisitely constructed all-in-one PCs that cost several</p><p>thousand dollars are available at the top of the market. A $3,000 gaming tower will not only provide enormous</p><p>computational capability for today, but it should also have so much room for growth and upgradeability that it will have a considerably longer useful life than any laptop. And that’s before you even explore the wacky world of custom PCs, which includes paint jobs that rival those on automobiles, liquid cooling, and extravagant</p><p>lighting and wiring.</p><p>Business PCs that are IT-manageable and security-conscious—the majority of which are now produced by Dell, HP, and Lenovo—have their own price dynamics and generally cost more. This is due to their expensive</p><p>warranty or maintenance packages as well as the potential addition of enterprise-specific silicon with a</p><p>manageability or security focus. Sometimes, a portion of the price premium for business desktops reflects the</p><p>PC manufacturer’s promise to keep extra parts and upgrades in stock for that model of computers for a specific amount of time in the future. As a result, IT professionals may rely on being able to maintain a fleet of a specific business machine for that period.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-desktops-are-recommended"><a href="#Part-2-What-desktops-are-recommended" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. What desktops are recommended?"></a>Part 2. What desktops are recommended?</h2><p>Choosing a new PC tower might be challenging, but we’ve outlined the top models for each function, from</p><p>gaming powerhouses to small PCs for your home office. You may use this list to locate the finest PC to meet</p><p>your demands, whether you’re a student, a busy professional, or an avid gamer.</p><h3 id="1-MSI-MEG-Aegis-Ti5"><a href="#1-MSI-MEG-Aegis-Ti5" class="headerlink" title="1. MSI MEG Aegis Ti5"></a>1. MSI MEG Aegis Ti5</h3><p>Even so, there are times when you just want the best of the best, the absolute cream of the crop. It won’t be</p><p>for everyone, of course. That, in our opinion, is the MSI MEG Aegis Ti5: a jaw-droppingly distinctive gaming PC with an almost absurdly powerful hardware setup. The front of the computer features a “Gamer Dial” that can be used to adjust system performance settings and display data or amusing animations on a tiny circular</p><p>display.</p><p>The MEG Aegis Ti5 is available in several versions, all of which have the newest gaming hardware. The</p><p>most recent top-spec setup uses an Nvidia RTX 3090 graphics card and an ultra-modern Intel Core i9-12900K</p><p>CPU, but there are many other variants available if that isn’t precisely what you’re looking for. Of course, the</p><p>majority of these models will set you back a good coin, but if performance is what you’re after, look no further.</p><h3 id="2-Corsair-One-i300"><a href="#2-Corsair-One-i300" class="headerlink" title="2. Corsair One i300"></a>2. Corsair One i300</h3><p>The Corsair One i300 is a brilliantly little workstation computer with top-tier performance in a footprint that is barely any larger than the Lenovo IdeaCentre Mini 5i, which is found higher on this list. It is a genuinely</p><p>innovative bit of computer hardware architecture. Due to its single fan positioned on the roof and perforated</p><p>side panels, it also operates more quietly than many powerful PCs.</p><p>Given its high-end internal components and expensive starting price, the One i300 is probably a little overkill</p><p>for the ordinary user. However, there is no doubt that this is the most potent small form factor PC currently on the market, and Corsair provides a choice of variants with AMD and Intel processors.</p><p>This is a great option if you’re searching for a high-end PC for resource-intensive content creation jobs or 4K</p><p>gaming (or both!). Fortunately, the hardware on offer here means that the Corsair One i300 should serve you</p><p>for years to come even though the extremely compact design makes it difficult, if not impossible, to pry open</p><p>the chassis to replace your components.</p><h3 id="3-Mac-Mini-M1-2020"><a href="#3-Mac-Mini-M1-2020" class="headerlink" title="3. Mac Mini (M1, 2020)"></a>3. Mac Mini (M1, 2020)</h3><p>The arrival of the Apple M1 chip meant new Mac hardware across the board, and naturally this included a</p><p>much-needed update to the smallest Apple computer: the Mac Mini. The 2020 M1 edition of this pint-sized</p><p>(Well, it’s actually smaller than a pint) Mac is more powerful than ever, with the new processor offering solid</p><p>performance in video editing, digital art, and even iOS gaming thanks to the new chip.</p><p>Despite this, it’s still Apple’s cheapest Mac ever, with the base model starting at $700 for 8GB of RAM and a</p><p>256GB drive. Budget-conscious Apple fans looking for the best computer need look no further; this is the</p><p>definitive version of the Mac Mini. It retains the same clean design as its predecessors, with a decent selection</p><p>of ports on the rear edge and a thick rubber base that keeps it from sliding around on your desk. The only</p><p>significant downside of the new model is that it can no longer use external GPUs, which could limit its potential</p><p>for users looking to run demanding graphics-intensive software.</p><h3 id="4-Lenovo-Yoga-A940"><a href="#4-Lenovo-Yoga-A940" class="headerlink" title="4. Lenovo Yoga A940"></a>4. Lenovo Yoga A940</h3><p>For digital artists, the Lenovo Yoga A940 is without a doubt the best desktop computer available. This feature - rich all-in-one PC from Lenovo is the company’s response to the iMac and is guaranteed to pique the interest of creative types. A magnificent 27-inch 4K display with outstanding contrast and color richness, a strong 25- degree rotating hinge, and a smart stylus are all included.</p><p>The included “content creation dial,” a clever addition that offers tactile control to a number of activities, such</p><p>as zooming in and out on a virtual canvas or scrolling across pages, may be plugged in on either side of the</p><p>screen. On the base of the device, there is also an LED light array and a wireless phone charging pad.</p><p>In general, the Yoga A940 outperforms sleek all-in-one laptops like the Apple iMac and Surface Studio 2, both of which choose clean, simple designs over cramming in exciting features like Lenovo has. Naturally, a mouse and keyboard are provided, though you might wish to update as they are a rather common set. The only significant drawback is the Yoga A940’s somewhat outdated internal components, which prevent it from</p><p>handling intensive tasks like 4K video editing.</p><h3 id="5-Azulle-Access4"><a href="#5-Azulle-Access4" class="headerlink" title="5. Azulle Access4"></a>5. Azulle Access4</h3><p>A stick PC can be the best option if you’re constantly on the road and would prefer not to lug along a heavy</p><p>laptop. These tiny computers, often known as “compute sticks,” are made to be plugged into a screen and used right away, making them ideal for professionals who work quickly. The Azulle Access4 may resemble a large flash drive more than a computer, but it can be hooked into any monitor with an HDMI port to turn it into a fully functional Windows or Linux PC.</p><p>The Access4 is simple to use and well-equipped for fundamental tasks like word processing or maintaining</p><p>spreadsheets thanks to its 4GB of RAM and Intel Celeron processor. Since there are no fans, it won’t even emit a whisper of noise and is small enough to put in your jacket pocket. For office workers who may have switched to a “hotdesking” environment, Azulle even sells a Zoom-oriented version that can transform any screen and webcam into an instant videoconferencing tool.</p><h3 id="6-Alienware-Aurora-R13"><a href="#6-Alienware-Aurora-R13" class="headerlink" title="6. Alienware Aurora R13"></a>6. Alienware Aurora R13</h3><p>Since so much of Alienware’s business is focused on making you a PC with the particular components you</p><p>desire, a judgment of the Aurora R13 is largely a judgment of the new Legend 2.0 chassis. And we can confirm</p><p>that the Aurora R13’s new appearance is a hit after working, playing, and tinkering with our review device for a few weeks.</p><p>Even after playing in 4K for hours, the redesigned chassis is simple to access, has lots of ports, and has enough</p><p>ventilation that I didn’t detect much more than a gentle hum and a pleasant warmth coming from the PC. The computer is a bit heavy to move about (mind those fins) or set down on a desk because it can weigh up to 35 pounds. However, if your desk has room for it, the futuristic style and programmable RGB lighting are sure to draw attention.</p><p>If you can afford it, Alienware will outfit the Aurora R13 with premium parts to turn it into a top-notch gaming</p><p>computer. Our review device is not cheap, costing close to $3,000, but it has the capacity to play today’s top</p><p>games in 1080p for years to come. Just be aware that you shouldn’t anticipate getting 4K framerates that are</p><p>lightning quick for that price; the Aurora R13 becomes just as pricey as the other PCs on our list when outfitted</p><p>with premium components.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-much-CPU-power-do-you-need"><a href="#Part-3-How-much-CPU-power-do-you-need" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. How much CPU power do you need?"></a>Part 3. How much CPU power do you need?</h2><p>A desktop tower’s utilization of a desktop-grade CPU is one of its key advantages. It may seem simple, but that is a crucial distinction.</p><p>The two largest PC processor manufacturers, AMD and Intel, provide desktop-class chips and laptop-class chips to system builders, although frequently the CPU model names are identical and difficult to distinguish. For instance, you can find Intel’s Core i7 in both laptops and desktops, but a “real” desktop CPU as opposed to one designed for a mobile device performs far better.</p><p>For challenging content creation tasks, PC gaming, or math and science projects, a desktop CPU gives you</p><p>additional power. Software developed to take advantage of the extra cores will profit from faster processors</p><p>with four, six, eight, or perhaps as many as 18 cores. In comparison to variants created for laptops, which must</p><p>be integrated into surroundings with less thermal and power-delivery leeway, the desktop version of a given</p><p>CPU will use more energy and produce more heat. The ability to multithread, which enables each of the CPU’s</p><p>cores to address two processing threads simultaneously rather of just one, is another important feature that</p><p>can be more easily included into a desktop CPU. When used with appropriate software, multithreading,</p><p>sometimes known as “Hyper-Threading” by Intel, can significantly improve performance.</p><p>High-end towers with enough of interior room are the only ones that can accommodate liquid cooling systems, which are only necessary for the very highest-end desktop CPUs. These are very specialized and expensive processors, so you should only use them if you have extremely particular software requirements that you are certain can take use of their higher base and peak clock rates as well as all of their addressable cores and threads. These are not only random purchases.</p><p>Contrarily, many AIOs and tiny PCs employ the same effective, cooler-running CPU designs as you may find in laptops. While most desktop chips have a “T” or “K” or simply a zero at the end, Intel often marks their mobile- first chip designs with a CPU name that contains “U,” “H,” or “P.” Despite having the same number of</p><p>processing cores as its desktop equivalent (four- and six-core CPUs are also frequently found in both), a mobile CPU’s maximum power consumption is frequently much lower. The average base and boost clock rates might also be slower, and the processor might not enable multithreading. However, a lot of desktop PC customers will be able to do their daily tasks and a little more with these lower-powered CPUs.</p><p>Common users should look for an Intel Core i5 or AMD Ryzen 5 for a typical tower with a true desktop-grade</p><p>CPU; the Core i7 and Ryzen 7 are also excellent, powerful options, but overkill for most people who aren’t</p><p>serious PC gamers, intensive multitaskers, prosumer or pro video or image manipulators. However, if CPU</p><p>power is a top priority, these should be adequate.</p><p>Only if you are aware that your workflow is being slowed down by insufficient cores or threads or if you have</p><p>extremely high internal storage requirements are the Core i9, Ryzen 9, Ryzen Threadripper, and Core X-Series</p><p>worth the money (for which the Threadripper and Core X can help with internal resources).</p><h2 id="Part-4-What-graphics-card-do-you-need"><a href="#Part-4-What-graphics-card-do-you-need" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. What graphics card do you need?"></a>Part 4. What graphics card do you need?</h2><p>If you want to construct your own PC or purchase the greatest gaming PC, investing in the best graphics card is essential. More crucial than the CPU is the graphics card. Unfortunately, figuring out how to purchase a GPU might be challenging. There are other factors to consider, including the type of monitor you’re using (for</p><p>suggestions, check our Best Gaming Monitors page, which opens in a new browser), the size of your PC case,</p><p>and the game settings you want to use.</p><p>The considerations you should make while choosing your next GPU are listed below. To evaluate how today’s</p><p>GPUs stack up against earlier cards that you might be wanting to replace or upgrade, check out our list of the</p><p>best graphics cards available right now. You can also view the GPU Benchmarks Hierarchy.</p><p>Thankfully, the supply and GPU costs for AMD’s RX 6000 cards and Nvidia’s RTX 30-series cards both continue</p><p>to rise. After 18 months of exorbitant costs, the majority of cards can now be obtained online for only 20–30%</p><p>over MSRP, occasionally even less. However, keep in mind that next-generation GPUs, like as the Nvidia ‘Ada’</p><p>RTX 40-series and AMD’s RDNA3, are soon to be released.</p><p>Even though there are several manufacturers and hundreds of graphics cards, only Nvidia and AMD actually</p><p>produce the GPUs that power these devices; however, Intel’s Xe Graphics has started shipping for laptops and</p><p>will likely be available for desktops in the near future as well. AMD is more competitive than it has been in</p><p>recent years with Nvidia and its current-generation Ampere cards, including the GeForce RTX 3080, thanks to</p><p>its RX 6000 cards.</p><p>But real-time ray tracing is the unseen, realistically lit elephant in the room that we have been ignoring up to</p><p>this point. “Team Green” is now using its second generation of RTX with 30-series GPUs, which was first</p><p>introduced as a significant new feature with Nvidia’s then-current-generation RTX 20-series cards. With its RX 6000 cards, AMD (“Team Red”) made a significant entry into this market in 2020. However, because real-time ray tracing is still new to AMD, it trails behind Nvidia in this area.</p><p>However, the development of games that use ray tracing effectively has lagged behind. There’s no denying that more games are adding ray tracing functionality, and there will be a lot more in the future since the Sony</p><p>PlayStation 5 and Microsoft Series S|X consoles also support it. There are currently just a select few video</p><p>games that make use of ray tracing in a manner that we would consider to be outstanding.</p><p>The value for the money will be significantly increased by going down a notch or two. For instance, an RTX 3080 12GB is now available for under $1,000. Those costs half as much as the RTX 3090 Ti and has an average</p><p>performance reduction of 15%. The AMD side is the same. The RX 6700 XT (opens in new tab) is available for</p><p>half as much as the RX 6900 XT (opens in new tab), which costs approximately $1,050. The 6900 is undoubtedly</p><p>speedier, but is it really worth spending twice as much money? You are the only one who can make the choice.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>The functioning of your PC and the purposes for which you use it will determine which computer brand is ideal. If you prefer Windows operating systems, Dell and Lenovo offer excellent desktop computers, but Apple also makes excellent desktop computers if you can afford how pricey they may be. On the other hand, if you’re searching for the best gaming PC, you should consider brands like MSI, Corsair, or even Dell-owned Alienware if you want a PC with gaming skills. The ideal computer brand for you will ultimately rely on what you want your PC to be able to do as many computer brands offer the highest quality, most reasonably priced PCs.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-much-does-a-desktop-cost-1"><a href="#Part-1-How-much-does-a-desktop-cost-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

What desktops are recommended?</h2><p>Choosing a new PC tower might be challenging, but we’ve outlined the top models for each function, from</p><p>gaming powerhouses to small PCs for your home office. You may use this list to locate the finest PC to meet</p><p>your demands, whether you’re a student, a busy professional, or an avid gamer.</p><h3 id="1-MSI-MEG-Aegis-Ti5-1"><a href="#1-MSI-MEG-Aegis-Ti5-1" class="headerlink" title="1. MSI MEG Aegis Ti5"></a>1. MSI MEG Aegis Ti5</h3><p>Even so, there are times when you just want the best of the best, the absolute cream of the crop. It won’t be</p><p>for everyone, of course. That, in our opinion, is the MSI MEG Aegis Ti5: a jaw-droppingly distinctive gaming PC with an almost absurdly powerful hardware setup. The front of the computer features a “Gamer Dial” that can be used to adjust system performance settings and display data or amusing animations on a tiny circular</p><p>display.</p><p>The MEG Aegis Ti5 is available in several versions, all of which have the newest gaming hardware. The</p><p>most recent top-spec setup uses an Nvidia RTX 3090 graphics card and an ultra-modern Intel Core i9-12900K</p><p>CPU, but there are many other variants available if that isn’t precisely what you’re looking for. Of course, the</p><p>majority of these models will set you back a good coin, but if performance is what you’re after, look no further.</p><h3 id="2-Corsair-One-i300-1"><a href="#2-Corsair-One-i300-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Corsair One i300"></a>2. Corsair One i300</h3><p>The Corsair One i300 is a brilliantly little workstation computer with top-tier performance in a footprint that is barely any larger than the Lenovo IdeaCentre Mini 5i, which is found higher on this list. It is a genuinely</p><p>innovative bit of computer hardware architecture. Due to its single fan positioned on the roof and perforated</p><p>side panels, it also operates more quietly than many powerful PCs.</p><p>Given its high-end internal components and expensive starting price, the One i300 is probably a little overkill</p><p>for the ordinary user. However, there is no doubt that this is the most potent small form factor PC currently on the market, and Corsair provides a choice of variants with AMD and Intel processors.</p><p>This is a great option if you’re searching for a high-end PC for resource-intensive content creation jobs or 4K</p><p>gaming (or both!). Fortunately, the hardware on offer here means that the Corsair One i300 should serve you</p><p>for years to come even though the extremely compact design makes it difficult, if not impossible, to pry open</p><p>the chassis to replace your components.</p><h3 id="3-Mac-Mini-M1-2020-1"><a href="#3-Mac-Mini-M1-2020-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Mac Mini (M1, 2020)"></a>3. Mac Mini (M1, 2020)</h3><p>The arrival of the Apple M1 chip meant new Mac hardware across the board, and naturally this included a</p><p>much-needed update to the smallest Apple computer: the Mac Mini. The 2020 M1 edition of this pint-sized</p><p>(Well, it’s actually smaller than a pint) Mac is more powerful than ever, with the new processor offering solid</p><p>performance in video editing, digital art, and even iOS gaming thanks to the new chip.</p><p>Despite this, it’s still Apple’s cheapest Mac ever, with the base model starting at $700 for 8GB of RAM and a</p><p>256GB drive. Budget-conscious Apple fans looking for the best computer need look no further; this is the</p><p>definitive version of the Mac Mini. It retains the same clean design as its predecessors, with a decent selection</p><p>of ports on the rear edge and a thick rubber base that keeps it from sliding around on your desk. The only</p><p>significant downside of the new model is that it can no longer use external GPUs, which could limit its potential</p><p>for users looking to run demanding graphics-intensive software.</p><h3 id="4-Lenovo-Yoga-A940-1"><a href="#4-Lenovo-Yoga-A940-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Lenovo Yoga A940"></a>4. Lenovo Yoga A940</h3><p>For digital artists, the Lenovo Yoga A940 is without a doubt the best desktop computer available. This feature - rich all-in-one PC from Lenovo is the company’s response to the iMac and is guaranteed to pique the interest of creative types. A magnificent 27-inch 4K display with outstanding contrast and color richness, a strong 25- degree rotating hinge, and a smart stylus are all included.</p><p>The included “content creation dial,” a clever addition that offers tactile control to a number of activities, such</p><p>as zooming in and out on a virtual canvas or scrolling across pages, may be plugged in on either side of the</p><p>screen. On the base of the device, there is also an LED light array and a wireless phone charging pad.</p><p>In general, the Yoga A940 outperforms sleek all-in-one laptops like the Apple iMac and Surface Studio 2, both of which choose clean, simple designs over cramming in exciting features like Lenovo has. Naturally, a mouse and keyboard are provided, though you might wish to update as they are a rather common set. The only significant drawback is the Yoga A940’s somewhat outdated internal components, which prevent it from</p><p>handling intensive tasks like 4K video editing.</p><h3 id="5-Azulle-Access4-1"><a href="#5-Azulle-Access4-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Azulle Access4"></a>5. Azulle Access4</h3><p>A stick PC can be the best option if you’re constantly on the road and would prefer not to lug along a heavy</p><p>laptop. These tiny computers, often known as “compute sticks,” are made to be plugged into a screen and used right away, making them ideal for professionals who work quickly. The Azulle Access4 may resemble a large flash drive more than a computer, but it can be hooked into any monitor with an HDMI port to turn it into a fully functional Windows or Linux PC.</p><p>The Access4 is simple to use and well-equipped for fundamental tasks like word processing or maintaining</p><p>spreadsheets thanks to its 4GB of RAM and Intel Celeron processor. Since there are no fans, it won’t even emit a whisper of noise and is small enough to put in your jacket pocket. For office workers who may have switched to a “hotdesking” environment, Azulle even sells a Zoom-oriented version that can transform any screen and webcam into an instant videoconferencing tool.</p><h3 id="6-Alienware-Aurora-R13-1"><a href="#6-Alienware-Aurora-R13-1" class="headerlink" title="6. Alienware Aurora R13"></a>6. Alienware Aurora R13</h3><p>Since so much of Alienware’s business is focused on making you a PC with the particular components you</p><p>desire, a judgment of the Aurora R13 is largely a judgment of the new Legend 2.0 chassis. And we can confirm</p><p>that the Aurora R13’s new appearance is a hit after working, playing, and tinkering with our review device for a few weeks.</p><p>Even after playing in 4K for hours, the redesigned chassis is simple to access, has lots of ports, and has enough</p><p>ventilation that I didn’t detect much more than a gentle hum and a pleasant warmth coming from the PC. The computer is a bit heavy to move about (mind those fins) or set down on a desk because it can weigh up to 35 pounds. However, if your desk has room for it, the futuristic style and programmable RGB lighting are sure to draw attention.</p><p>If you can afford it, Alienware will outfit the Aurora R13 with premium parts to turn it into a top-notch gaming</p><p>computer. Our review device is not cheap, costing close to $3,000, but it has the capacity to play today’s top</p><p>games in 1080p for years to come. Just be aware that you shouldn’t anticipate getting 4K framerates that are</p><p>lightning quick for that price; the Aurora R13 becomes just as pricey as the other PCs on our list when outfitted</p><p>with premium components.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-much-CPU-power-do-you-need-1"><a href="#Part-3-How-much-CPU-power-do-you-need-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. How much CPU power do you need?"></a>Part 3. How much CPU power do you need?</h2><p>A desktop tower’s utilization of a desktop-grade CPU is one of its key advantages. It may seem simple, but that is a crucial distinction.</p><p>The two largest PC processor manufacturers, AMD and Intel, provide desktop-class chips and laptop-class chips to system builders, although frequently the CPU model names are identical and difficult to distinguish. For instance, you can find Intel’s Core i7 in both laptops and desktops, but a “real” desktop CPU as opposed to one designed for a mobile device performs far better.</p><p>For challenging content creation tasks, PC gaming, or math and science projects, a desktop CPU gives you</p><p>additional power. Software developed to take advantage of the extra cores will profit from faster processors</p><p>with four, six, eight, or perhaps as many as 18 cores. In comparison to variants created for laptops, which must</p><p>be integrated into surroundings with less thermal and power-delivery leeway, the desktop version of a given</p><p>CPU will use more energy and produce more heat. The ability to multithread, which enables each of the CPU’s</p><p>cores to address two processing threads simultaneously rather of just one, is another important feature that</p><p>can be more easily included into a desktop CPU. When used with appropriate software, multithreading,</p><p>sometimes known as “Hyper-Threading” by Intel, can significantly improve performance.</p><p>High-end towers with enough of interior room are the only ones that can accommodate liquid cooling systems, which are only necessary for the very highest-end desktop CPUs. These are very specialized and expensive processors, so you should only use them if you have extremely particular software requirements that you are certain can take use of their higher base and peak clock rates as well as all of their addressable cores and threads. These are not only random purchases.</p><p>Contrarily, many AIOs and tiny PCs employ the same effective, cooler-running CPU designs as you may find in laptops. While most desktop chips have a “T” or “K” or simply a zero at the end, Intel often marks their mobile- first chip designs with a CPU name that contains “U,” “H,” or “P.” Despite having the same number of</p><p>processing cores as its desktop equivalent (four- and six-core CPUs are also frequently found in both), a mobile CPU’s maximum power consumption is frequently much lower. The average base and boost clock rates might also be slower, and the processor might not enable multithreading. However, a lot of desktop PC customers will be able to do their daily tasks and a little more with these lower-powered CPUs.</p><p>Common users should look for an Intel Core i5 or AMD Ryzen 5 for a typical tower with a true desktop-grade</p><p>CPU; the Core i7 and Ryzen 7 are also excellent, powerful options, but overkill for most people who aren’t</p><p>serious PC gamers, intensive multitaskers, prosumer or pro video or image manipulators. However, if CPU</p><p>power is a top priority, these should be adequate.</p><p>Only if you are aware that your workflow is being slowed down by insufficient cores or threads or if you have</p><p>extremely high internal storage requirements are the Core i9, Ryzen 9, Ryzen Threadripper, and Core X-Series</p><p>worth the money (for which the Threadripper and Core X can help with internal resources).</p><h2 id="Part-4-What-graphics-card-do-you-need-1"><a href="#Part-4-What-graphics-card-do-you-need-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. What graphics card do you need?"></a>Part 4. What graphics card do you need?</h2><p>If you want to construct your own PC or purchase the greatest gaming PC, investing in the best graphics card is essential. More crucial than the CPU is the graphics card. Unfortunately, figuring out how to purchase a GPU might be challenging. There are other factors to consider, including the type of monitor you’re using (for</p><p>suggestions, check our Best Gaming Monitors page, which opens in a new browser), the size of your PC case,</p><p>and the game settings you want to use.</p><p>The considerations you should make while choosing your next GPU are listed below. To evaluate how today’s</p><p>GPUs stack up against earlier cards that you might be wanting to replace or upgrade, check out our list of the</p><p>best graphics cards available right now. You can also view the GPU Benchmarks Hierarchy.</p><p>Thankfully, the supply and GPU costs for AMD’s RX 6000 cards and Nvidia’s RTX 30-series cards both continue</p><p>to rise. After 18 months of exorbitant costs, the majority of cards can now be obtained online for only 20–30%</p><p>over MSRP, occasionally even less. However, keep in mind that next-generation GPUs, like as the Nvidia ‘Ada’</p><p>RTX 40-series and AMD’s RDNA3, are soon to be released.</p><p>Even though there are several manufacturers and hundreds of graphics cards, only Nvidia and AMD actually</p><p>produce the GPUs that power these devices; however, Intel’s Xe Graphics has started shipping for laptops and</p><p>will likely be available for desktops in the near future as well. AMD is more competitive than it has been in</p><p>recent years with Nvidia and its current-generation Ampere cards, including the GeForce RTX 3080, thanks to</p><p>its RX 6000 cards.</p><p>But real-time ray tracing is the unseen, realistically lit elephant in the room that we have been ignoring up to</p><p>this point. “Team Green” is now using its second generation of RTX with 30-series GPUs, which was first</p><p>introduced as a significant new feature with Nvidia’s then-current-generation RTX 20-series cards. With its RX 6000 cards, AMD (“Team Red”) made a significant entry into this market in 2020. However, because real-time ray tracing is still new to AMD, it trails behind Nvidia in this area.</p><p>However, the development of games that use ray tracing effectively has lagged behind. There’s no denying that more games are adding ray tracing functionality, and there will be a lot more in the future since the Sony</p><p>PlayStation 5 and Microsoft Series S|X consoles also support it. There are currently just a select few video</p><p>games that make use of ray tracing in a manner that we would consider to be outstanding.</p><p>The value for the money will be significantly increased by going down a notch or two. For instance, an RTX 3080 12GB is now available for under $1,000. Those costs half as much as the RTX 3090 Ti and has an average</p><p>performance reduction of 15%. The AMD side is the same. The RX 6700 XT (opens in new tab) is available for</p><p>half as much as the RX 6900 XT (opens in new tab), which costs approximately $1,050. The 6900 is undoubtedly</p><p>speedier, but is it really worth spending twice as much money? You are the only one who can make the choice.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>The functioning of your PC and the purposes for which you use it will determine which computer brand is ideal. If you prefer Windows operating systems, Dell and Lenovo offer excellent desktop computers, but Apple also makes excellent desktop computers if you can afford how pricey they may be. On the other hand, if you’re searching for the best gaming PC, you should consider brands like MSI, Corsair, or even Dell-owned Alienware if you want a PC with gaming skills. The ideal computer brand for you will ultimately rely on what you want your PC to be able to do as many computer brands offer the highest quality, most reasonably priced PCs.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/2024-approved-essential-watchlist-15-must-see-stop-motion-classics/"><u>2024 Approved  Essential Watchlist  15 Must-See Stop-Motion Classics</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-the-ultimate-starters-guide-to-understanding-and-using-green-screens/"><u>[New] The Ultimate Starter’s Guide to Understanding and Using Green Screens</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/in-2024-budgeted-skyvault-storing-mountains-of-data/"><u>In 2024, Budgeted SkyVault  Storing Mountains of Data</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-the-ultimate-path-to-stunning-hdr-portraits/"><u>[Updated] The Ultimate Path to Stunning HDR Portraits</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-reviewing-the-newest-2023-samsung-bd-j5900-model/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Reviewing the Newest 2023 Samsung BD-J5900 Model</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-background-excision-tool-affinity-photo/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Background Excision Tool Affinity Photo</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/2024-approved-integrating-soundscapes-with-fusion-studios-tips/"><u>2024 Approved  Integrating Soundscapes with Fusion Studio's Tips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/2024-approved-prime-practices-for-streaming-live-cricket-events/"><u>2024 Approved  Prime Practices for Streaming Live Cricket Events</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-panoramic-lenses-vs-depth-filled-images-for-2024/"><u>[New] Panoramic Lenses vs Depth-Filled Images for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-bringing-dimensionality-to-text-a-photo-editing-masterclass/"><u>[New] Bringing Dimensionality to Text  A Photo Editing Masterclass</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/2024-approved-converting-spoken-words-to-text-in-powerpoint/"><u>2024 Approved  Converting Spoken Words to Text in PowerPoint</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/in-2024-shape-business-visions-no-money-just-templates/"><u>In 2024, Shape Business Visions - No Money, Just Templates</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/in-2024-new-horizons-in-video-codecs-comparing-av1-and-vp9/"><u>In 2024, New Horizons in Video Codecs  Comparing Av1 and VP9</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/creating-a-channel-focused-on-reviewing-marketplace-items-for-2024/"><u>Creating a Channel Focused on Reviewing Marketplace Items for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/mastering-image-browsing-the-ultimate-guide-to-pexels-wonders-for-2024/"><u>Mastering Image Browsing  The Ultimate Guide to Pexels Wonders for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/updated-a-closer-look-at-earnings-comparing-dailymotion-and-youtube-revenues/"><u>[Updated] A Closer Look at Earnings  Comparing Dailymotion and YouTube Revenues</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-understanding-igtv-vs-youtube-a-comprehensive-feature-breakdown/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Understanding IGTV Vs.

That’s why you should choose a camera that offers the following options</p><h3 id="Manual-Focus-and-Controls"><a href="#Manual-Focus-and-Controls" class="headerlink" title="Manual Focus and Controls"></a>Manual Focus and Controls</h3><p> Being able to control the focus manually is vital for the success of your stop motion video project. The objects in the shot are moving constantly, which can make it difficult for camera’s autofocus to keep the focus where you want it to be. That’s why the camera you use for stop motion photography must offer the manual focus option.</p><p> Moreover, controlling the ISO, aperture and exposure values by yourself is as important as pulling the focus manually, since even the slightest light change can cause a sea of continuity problems.</p><h3 id="Remote-Shutter-Release"><a href="#Remote-Shutter-Release" class="headerlink" title="Remote Shutter Release"></a>Remote Shutter Release</h3><p> The camera must be perfectly still throughout the entire process, and sometimes just placing the camera on a tripod is not going to be enough. That’s why you should opt for a camera that allows you to release the shutter remotely and avoid causing even the slightest vibration of a camera.</p><h3 id="Electronic-Shutter"><a href="#Electronic-Shutter" class="headerlink" title="Electronic Shutter"></a>Electronic Shutter</h3><p> Most mechanical shutters have an estimated lifetime of 100.000 shots, but a single stop motion video can easily have thousands of images.

The optics of iPhone cameras are without question powerful, but it is the combination of the software and the hardware that makes these cameras truly unique.</p><p><strong>You may also like:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Best Camera Apps for iPhone X&#x2F;10&#x2F;8 Plus&#x2F;7 Plus <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Each iPhone photographer has to ask themselves the same question: ‘Am I really using the full capacity of my camera?’If the answer is no, maybe these iPhone camera features can help you improve the quality of your photos.</p><h2 id="10-iPhone-Camera-Features-You-Should-Know-in-iOS-11-1"><a href="#10-iPhone-Camera-Features-You-Should-Know-in-iOS-11-1" class="headerlink" title="10 iPhone Camera Features You Should Know in iOS 11"></a>10 iPhone Camera Features You Should Know in iOS 11</h2><p> The quality of your photos is in direct relation to your level of familiarity with the camera’s features because the more you know about the camera the better you will be at finding the proper use for those features.</p><h4 id="1-Don’t-Be-Shy-to-Use-the-Grid-Mode"><a href="#1-Don’t-Be-Shy-to-Use-the-Grid-Mode" class="headerlink" title="1.

Fortunately, the iPhone camera app offers the Grid Mode that divides the screen into nine equal parts. The grid will provide assistance in placing the subjects of your photos at the very center of the picture or when learning how to use the rule of thirds, one of the most basic composition techniques in photography.</p><h4 id="2-Set-the-Focus-and-Exposure-manually"><a href="#2-Set-the-Focus-and-Exposure-manually" class="headerlink" title="2.

Even though your iPhone is perfectly capable of setting the exposure or focus automatically, adjusting these values manually will provide you with more control over the process of taking a photo. Choosing where the focal point in your photo will be and finding the perfect exposure by yourself will allow you to highlight the subjects of your pictures and it will enable you to decide how bright or dark your photo is going to be.</p><h4 id="3-HDR-Photos-Have-More-Balanced-Lightning"><a href="#3-HDR-Photos-Have-More-Balanced-Lightning" class="headerlink" title="3.

When activated, HDR feature will allow your iPhone to combine three different exposures in a single shot, and the result will be a picture that has a higher amount of detail in its shadows and highlights.</p><h4 id="4-Use-the-Timer-to-Stabilize-Your-Shots"><a href="#4-Use-the-Timer-to-Stabilize-Your-Shots" class="headerlink" title="4.

This complicates things even further in difficult light conditions, but the Timer feature on iPhone X can help you solve this problem. You can compose your shot and set the Timer for 3 or 10 seconds and the device will take ten photos in a row, which will enable you to select the sharpest photo and delete the others.</p><h4 id="5-Edit-Live-Photos"><a href="#5-Edit-Live-Photos" class="headerlink" title="5.

This is only if necessary, so see the previewed images to decide if you want to keep the default settings or not.</p><p>Step4In some of the exposure-bracketed pictures that merge, there are patches of semi-transparent spots in the HDR image. To avoid this, you can adjust deghosting between None and High, based on how many of the different artifacts you want to remove.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/create-and-merge-stunning-hdr-images-in-lightroom-4.jpg"                      alt="deghosting between none and high"                ></p><p>Step5Preview all changes and make further adjustments, if necessary.</p><p>Step6After the merging takes place, click on the Create Stack choice to group multiple exposure-bracketed images. After you do so, the HDR image will appear at the front position of the stacked images.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/create-and-merge-stunning-hdr-images-in-lightroom-5.jpg"                      alt="click on the create stack choice"                ></p><p>Step7Click the Merge button to save the HDR photo as a .dng image file.</p><h2 id="Is-Lightroom-or-Photoshop-better-for-HDR"><a href="#Is-Lightroom-or-Photoshop-better-for-HDR" class="headerlink" title="Is Lightroom or Photoshop better for HDR?"></a>Is Lightroom or Photoshop better for HDR?</h2><p>Both Photoshop and Lightroom are suitable solutions for different improvements to image processing quality. But there are variations between these two Adobe productions.</p><h3 id="Lightroom-has-many-editing-pre-sets"><a href="#Lightroom-has-many-editing-pre-sets" class="headerlink" title="Lightroom has many editing pre-sets"></a>Lightroom has many editing pre-sets</h3><p>To note, many <strong>HDR Lightroom presets</strong> are available for more accessible editing work, like merging images after selecting multiple shots in the Library grid view. You can right-click on top of the chosen pictures and edit them in the HDR Pro (Photoshop) platforms. It will automatically begin the merging process.</p><h3 id="Lightroom-merges-in-HDR-Raw-format"><a href="#Lightroom-merges-in-HDR-Raw-format" class="headerlink" title="Lightroom merges in HDR Raw format"></a>Lightroom merges in HDR Raw format</h3><p>However, while Photoshop HDR Pro is notable for HDR-centric editing and merging, Lightroom allows users to merge the RAW files in the software into HDR RAW files. So, photographers using <strong>Lightroom HDR merge</strong> can customize the images better and provide higher dynamic range quality with no formatting change. On the other hand, Photoshop allows Photoshop PSD file type merging mainly.</p><h3 id="Photoshop-HDR-Pro-offers-8-bit-16-bit-32-bit-file-options"><a href="#Photoshop-HDR-Pro-offers-8-bit-16-bit-32-bit-file-options" class="headerlink" title="Photoshop HDR Pro offers 8-bit&#x2F;16-bit&#x2F;32-bit file options"></a>Photoshop HDR Pro offers 8-bit&#x2F;16-bit&#x2F;32-bit file options</h3><p>The Photoshop HDR Pro version allows 8-bit&#x2F;16-bit files. You can change them to 32-bit files by tapping the top-right section of this software window. Here, you can use the setting “Complete Toning in Adobe Raw” instead of operating the standard HDR editor controls. You can also control the ghosting mode here.</p><h3 id="Photoshop-vs-Lightroom-Deghosting-feature"><a href="#Photoshop-vs-Lightroom-Deghosting-feature" class="headerlink" title="Photoshop vs. Lightroom Deghosting feature"></a>Photoshop vs. Lightroom Deghosting feature</h3><p>On the other hand, features like <strong>Lightroom bracketing</strong> make it a suitable choice for photo editing. The HDR Merge Preview allows users to see the chosen images before any processing is started. The default settings for Deghost Amount, Auto Tone, and Auto Align are ticked, with the Deghost choice set as None.</p><p>After making any changes, you can tap the Merge button to complete the whole process. Lightroom automatically saves the image you merge in 32-bit .dng file format, adding a suffix-HDR to the file’s name. You can edit the standard file in the Develop environment later.</p><p>So, in terms of 32-bit processing, both products are helpful, but customization options are more with Photoshop.</p><p><strong>Pros &amp; Cons for Lightroom HDR</strong></p><p>Pros</p><ul><li>Automatically saves image files in 32.bit DNG format.</li><li>Better learning curve compared to the Photoshop HDR Pro version.</li><li>Easy load multiple bracketing images to do <strong>Lightroom HDR merge</strong> via the Library.</li></ul><p>Cons</p><ul><li>Does not include 8 and 16-bit options as default.</li><li>Blurry images are still possible after processing.</li></ul><p><strong>Pros &amp; Cons for Photoshop HDR Pro</strong></p><p>Pros</p><ul><li>No stand-alone software is necessary to use this feature.</li><li>More personalization benefits with 32-fit file editing.</li><li>You can use both editing and tone mapping functions separately and get realistic image looks.</li></ul><p>Cons</p><ul><li>More artifacts that require extra cleaning can appear if there are many moving objects visible in one scene.</li><li>Beginners will struggle with this solution since it is relatively complex.</li></ul><h3 id="Comparison-Table-Between-Lightroom-and-Photoshop"><a href="#Comparison-Table-Between-Lightroom-and-Photoshop" class="headerlink" title="Comparison Table Between Lightroom and Photoshop"></a>Comparison Table Between Lightroom and Photoshop</h3><p>For a more precise understanding, here is a comparative overview of the HDR functionality in Adobe <strong>Lightroom HDR</strong> and Photoshop products.

Irrespectively of its extreme popularity, the platform still lacks certain basic options that are essential for the convenience of the users. For example, you are watching a YouTube video, and you notice something interesting and curious in the background of the subject. You will want to zoom into that portion of the video so that the minute details become visible. However, there is no built-in zoom YouTube video option available.</p><p>The requirement of zooming into YouTube videos is quite basic, and you will definitely need it at some point. You need to zoom videos to magnify and read texts as well as pay attention to details. In spite of YouTube video zoom option not available, there are several ways possible through which you can zoom into any YouTube videos conveniently. We will illustrate all the ways with detailed steps for complete understanding.</p><h2 id="Way-1-Use-Browser-Zoom-Feature"><a href="#Way-1-Use-Browser-Zoom-Feature" class="headerlink" title="Way 1. Use Browser Zoom Feature"></a>Way 1. Use Browser Zoom Feature</h2><p>If you are viewing YouTube videos from your web browser on your computer or smartphone, you can easily zoom into the video. This is because every web browser has the built-in option for zooming the browser window. As the browser window zooms in, the YouTube video playing in the browser will also zoom in. You have to then scroll and place the YouTube video in the center of the browser window for the best result. Here are the steps on how to zoom in YouTube using browser Zoom feature.</p><p>Step1Open your web browser and visit the YouTube website. Play the desired video.</p><p>Step2Click on the three-dot icon at the top-right corner, and you will see a drop-down menu.</p><p>Step3Go to Zoom option and click on “+” to zoom the browser window and thereby, zooming on YouTube video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/zoom-in-youtube-1.jpg"                      alt="browser zoom youtube video"                ></p><p>Play the video in theatre mode for a better zooming result. Alternatively, you can press Ctrl and “+” keys together to zoom in by percentage.</p><p>When you zoom in on YouTube video using browser zoom feature, the zooming is not very accurate because it does not actually zoom the focused part of the video. The zooming is uniform and you have to place the video on the browser window for the zoom effect to be somewhat effective.</p><h2 id="Way-2-Zoom-YouTube-Video-with-Filmora"><a href="#Way-2-Zoom-YouTube-Video-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Way 2.
