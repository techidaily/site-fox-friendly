Clip arts help create illustrations and backgrounds, giving customers a positive first impression. But getting the perfect clip art is a different story altogether. You might need to hire a quality photographer, who may set you back good money. But thankfully, you can download <strong>royalty-free clipart</strong> from hundreds of websites if you don’t have the time or money to hire a photographer. So, in this article, we want to discuss the best websites to get high-quality copyright-free clipart. But first, let’s discuss what clipart is.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Clip-Art"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Clip-Art" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Clip Art?"></a>Part 1: What is Clip Art?</h2><p>Clip art might sound alien to you if you’re still new to photography and website building. Well, clipart or clip art is simply a graphic image made using pre-made photos. Typically, clipart is used for illustrations on printed or electronic media. Besides websites, you can also find clip art on infographics, mobile applications, trademarks, logos, and more.</p><p>But why use clip art instead of traditional photos on your website? The thing is that clip arts look more cartoonish. This gives them a more universal feel on whatever website you’re working on. In addition, clip art will seamlessly fit inside your texts because they don’t have rigid triangular frames like stock photos. Of course, this can make your page more interesting.</p><p>In the meantime, clip art can come in numerous file formats but is divided into two categories. They include:</p><ul><li><strong>Vector graphics</strong>: Vector graphics are images generated directly from geometrical shapes. Because of this, vector graphics give more explicit clip art than traditional photos. In fact, vector illustrations can be printed or processed at the highest resolution without losing the original quality. SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is the most used vector graphic format on HTML5 browsers like Safari, Firefox, Chrome, Edge, and Opera.</li><li><strong>Bitmap:</strong> Bitmap is a raster image for creating website designs. BMP images provide smooth color transitions with a wide array of shades. Just think of it as a mosaic which uses a close set of materials or stone. However, bitmaps have limited resolution quality, leading to blurry or grainy results after printing. The most common bitmap formats you can use on your website project include JPG, PNG, GIF, and WebP.</li></ul><p>It is also worth noting that clip art images are governed by usage or copyright acts. The most common rights include royalty-free, rights managed, and <strong>public domain clip art</strong>. So, in this guidepost, we’ll focus on where to get a public domain and royalty-free clip arts, which are available to use without paying licensing fees.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Best-Sites-with-Public-Domain-Clip-Art"><a href="#Part-2-Best-Sites-with-Public-Domain-Clip-Art" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Best Sites with Public Domain Clip Art"></a>Part 2: Best Sites with Public Domain Clip Art</h2><p>A public domain image is clip art that never had any copyright in the first place.

The amount of music and videos being made is much higher than ever. Due to this, the budget range is quite broad and can be quite confusing for first-timers. Although some people use record labels to pay for their music videos, others pay out-of-pocket.</p><p>When shooting a music video, you have to recognize that a lot goes into shooting the music video.

Luckily, we’re here to break down how much it will cost to shoot a music video for you. Then, you can use the information shared here to start planning your next music video.</p><p><strong>How Much Will It Cost to Shoot a Music Video?</strong></p><p>We’re noticing a shift in the music video category, with more people choosing to release video singles over audio singles. Additionally, several video-sharing platforms encourage artists to share and promote themselves in creative ways. However, how much will it cost to shoot a music video? Below is how you can determine the answer to that.</p><p><strong>Creating a Budget</strong></p><p>The budget for your music video usually covers pre-production, concept development, casting, storyboards, choreography, location fee, rehearsal, production equipment, on-camera talent, props, costumes, post-production, editing, and many more. For a professional video, you can budget anywhere from $20,000 to $500,000. Sometimes, it costs even more, depending on the concept you’re looking to achieve.</p><p>However, if you have a lower budget, you would have to forego the inclusion of high-end visual effects, expensive locations, and many more. However, you can still creatively convey your story even with a low budget.</p><p><strong>Estimated Production Costs</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/music-video-cost-2.jpg"                      alt="music-video-cost"                ></p><p>For an artist looking for a lower budget, the estimated cost of production for a day can range from $500 to $1,500. This usually depends on your location and the permits you need. There might be extras along the way, but this is the average amount to budget per day.</p><p>If you are shooting scenes in different outfits, you might also have to budget rental fees. This could significantly increase the cost of production, even without the inclusion of more factors like transportation and food during the shooting process. However, these are important because they determine how your video looks at the end. In addition, good locations can sometimes be pricey, and you might want to get a stylist for your wardrobe.</p><p>Additionally, artists have to consider the cost of production equipment. If you want professional options like a 4k camera and lighting kits, it will drastically increase the average production cost because they cost a lot to rent and maintain. However, you should note that the better the equipment, the higher the cost.</p><p><strong>Estimated Production Days</strong></p><p>Depending on the concept and storyboard of your video, it usually takes 2-3 days to edit your video after production. Sometimes, the editor’s fee determines how much editing will be carried out on your video. What makes up the cost of post-production includes the storage device for your video and the hourly cost of your editor. For example, if your editor would be using advanced visual effects, they could charge between 70-150 dollars for each hour. Colorists are also part of the post-production cost, and their fee usually depends on the final product quality you would like to achieve.</p><p><strong>Additional Costs</strong></p><p>Apart from production and post-production costs, there are several more costs you need to consider. These costs are essential because they help to make your video come together. One of the additional costs to consider is the cast and crew. A fantastic music video requires talented people. This could range from 7 to 30 people at the location. Sometimes it could be. It is hard to determine the cost of the cast and crew because while some people work on day rates, others accept payment at the end of a project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/music-video-cost-3.jpg"                      alt="music-video-cost"                ></p><p>You should also consider the cost of food as everyone has to be in the best state to shoot the music video.

Yes, this is because XML is a markup language based on Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML), and you will require technical knowledge to understand files in such formats. The file format allows the sharing of structured information between two different programs, programs, and people, or among locally and shared networks.</p><p>The question is which online tool can convert SRT to XML?

SSA is a more advanced subtitle file format, and it’s usually used in anime fansubs to either store subtitle data with video or to overlay subtitles on video while it’s being encoded. The subtitle is not really popular among video content creators. However, when the need to convert SRT to SSA arises, an online tool is the right solution to help you get the job done without error. And luckily, the prior mentioned GoTranscipt subtitle converter also supports such a conversion process.</p><p>The steps below explain the process.</p><p>Step1 Visit <a class="link"   href="https://toolslick.com/conversion/subtitle/srt-to-ssa" >ToolSlick <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Step2 Click the “Upload” button to upload your SRT file.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/convert-srt-to-xml-2.jpg"                      alt="convert srt to ssa"                ></p><p>Step3 Click Convert to begin SRT to SSA conversion.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/convert-srt-to-xml-3.jpg"                      alt="click convert to begin srt to ssa"                ></p><p>Step4 Finally, click the green Download icon to download the converted file to your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/convert-srt-to-xml-4.jpg"                      alt="clcik the green download icon"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Convert-SRT-to-TTML"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Convert-SRT-to-TTML" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Convert SRT to TTML"></a>Part 4: How to Convert SRT to TTML</h2><p>Formerly known as DFXP (Distribution Format Exchange Profile), TTML (Time Texture Markup Language) is a time text in online media used in authoring, transcoding, or exchanging time text information used for subtitles and captions of videos. Although this format is supported in most media players, it cannot be used in web browsers. However, some people still have personal reasons why they want to convert SRT to TTML. Irrespective of what your reason to convert SRT to TTML is, you need the help of an online tool to carry out the operation.</p><p>We used the Better Converter online tool to convert SRT to TTML here. Just follow the following steps to perform the task.</p><p>Step1 Open <a class="link"   href="https://www.better-converter.com/Subtitles-Converter/Str-to-TTML-Subtitle-Converter" >Better Converter <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in your browser.</p><p>Step2 Use the Browse button to upload your SRT file.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/convert-srt-to-xml-5.jpg"                      alt="use browse to upload srt file"                ></p><p>Step3 Once you upload the file, Better Converter will automatically convert it to TTML and download the file to your PC.

But first, what is SCC? SCC (Scenarist Closed Captions) is a closed caption file that is used as a sidecar file in video editing and production programs. Such programs use it in saving unrendered videos before exporting them to the final video format. Unlike SRT, this type of file format can only be opened in certain applications as it’s not a universally accepted format.</p><p>To convert SRT to SCC, you need an online converter, and here, we’ve explained the step-by-step process to convert SRT to SCC using REV online converter. It’s a reliable tool for the job.</p><p>Step1 Visit REV’s <a class="link"   href="https://www.rev.com/captionconverter" >official website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Step2 Click on Select.SRT Files to upload the SRT file you want to convert to SCC.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/convert-srt-to-xml-6.jpg"                      alt="click on select srt files"                ></p><p>Step3 Under Select Output Formats, choose Scenarist (.scc).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/convert-srt-to-xml-7.jpg"                      alt="choose scenarist"                ></p><p>Step4 Enter your email into the relevant box and click the Convert button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/convert-srt-to-xml-8.jpg"                      alt="enter email into relevant box"                ></p><p>The SRT file should be converted within a few minutes. Afterward, you can check for the converted files in your email.</p><h2 id="Part-6-How-to-Convert-SRT-to-FCPXML"><a href="#Part-6-How-to-Convert-SRT-to-FCPXML" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: How to Convert SRT to FCPXML"></a>Part 6: How to Convert SRT to FCPXML</h2><p>The FCPXML (Final Cut Pro XML) format is a totally different kind of caption file - it uses XML elements to describe data exchanged between the Final Cut Pro software and other third-party applications like Adobe Premiere Pro, LumaFusion, etc. This caption file format can only be used only on Final Cut Pro. So, if you’re looking to convert SRT to FCPXML, you also need an online tool. Although the online tool that converts SRT to FCPXML is very limited, the Resolver Tool is one that does the job correctly. However, it only works efficiently with PC. So, we advise you use a PC for this operation.</p><p>See the steps to perform the task below:</p><p>Step1 Open Resolver Tools in your PC browser.</p><p>Step2 Click on Choose File to upload the SRT file you want to convert.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/convert-srt-to-xml-9.jpg"                      alt="click on choose file to upload"                ></p><p>Step3 Select FCPXML to SRT 1.5 and edit output as per requirement.

And luckily, the prior mentioned GoTranscipt subtitle converter also supports such a conversion process.</p><p>The steps below explain the process.</p><p>Step1 Visit <a class="link"   href="https://toolslick.com/conversion/subtitle/srt-to-ssa" >ToolSlick <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Step2 Click the “Upload” button to upload your SRT file.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/convert-srt-to-xml-2.jpg"                      alt="convert srt to ssa"                ></p><p>Step3 Click Convert to begin SRT to SSA conversion.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/convert-srt-to-xml-3.jpg"                      alt="click convert to begin srt to ssa"                ></p><p>Step4 Finally, click the green Download icon to download the converted file to your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/convert-srt-to-xml-4.jpg"                      alt="clcik the green download icon"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Convert-SRT-to-TTML-1"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Convert-SRT-to-TTML-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Convert SRT to TTML"></a>Part 4: How to Convert SRT to TTML</h2><p>Formerly known as DFXP (Distribution Format Exchange Profile), TTML (Time Texture Markup Language) is a time text in online media used in authoring, transcoding, or exchanging time text information used for subtitles and captions of videos. Although this format is supported in most media players, it cannot be used in web browsers. However, some people still have personal reasons why they want to convert SRT to TTML. Irrespective of what your reason to convert SRT to TTML is, you need the help of an online tool to carry out the operation.</p><p>We used the Better Converter online tool to convert SRT to TTML here.

But first, what is SCC? SCC (Scenarist Closed Captions) is a closed caption file that is used as a sidecar file in video editing and production programs. Such programs use it in saving unrendered videos before exporting them to the final video format. Unlike SRT, this type of file format can only be opened in certain applications as it’s not a universally accepted format.</p><p>To convert SRT to SCC, you need an online converter, and here, we’ve explained the step-by-step process to convert SRT to SCC using REV online converter. It’s a reliable tool for the job.</p><p>Step1 Visit REV’s <a class="link"   href="https://www.rev.com/captionconverter" >official website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Step2 Click on Select.SRT Files to upload the SRT file you want to convert to SCC.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/convert-srt-to-xml-6.jpg"                      alt="click on select srt files"                ></p><p>Step3 Under Select Output Formats, choose Scenarist (.scc).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/convert-srt-to-xml-7.jpg"                      alt="choose scenarist"                ></p><p>Step4 Enter your email into the relevant box and click the Convert button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/convert-srt-to-xml-8.jpg"                      alt="enter email into relevant box"                ></p><p>The SRT file should be converted within a few minutes.

So, if you’re looking to convert SRT to FCPXML, you also need an online tool. Although the online tool that converts SRT to FCPXML is very limited, the Resolver Tool is one that does the job correctly. However, it only works efficiently with PC. So, we advise you use a PC for this operation.</p><p>See the steps to perform the task below:</p><p>Step1 Open Resolver Tools in your PC browser.</p><p>Step2 Click on Choose File to upload the SRT file you want to convert.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/convert-srt-to-xml-9.jpg"                      alt="click on choose file to upload"                ></p><p>Step3 Select FCPXML to SRT 1.5 and edit output as per requirement.

It can create footage in DCI and UHD quality and you can capture scenes in MOV, MP4, and AVCHD file formats. The camera has 1”-Type MOS Sensor which creates the background blur that is a trademark of professional film cameras. However, HC-X1 is a camcorder and for those who are used to interchangeable lens cameras, it may not be the right choice. On the other hand, its features guarantee that you will be able to produce footage of the highest standard.</p><hr><h4 id="2-Blackmagic-Design-URSA-Mini-4-6K-Digital-Cinema-Camera"><a href="#2-Blackmagic-Design-URSA-Mini-4-6K-Digital-Cinema-Camera" class="headerlink" title="2.

One of its many advantages over the cameras with similar capabilities is its size. The combinations of size and the EF lens mount that allows you to use a large number of different lenses enables you to shoot a wide range of different cinematic styles with this camera. Super-35mm CMOS Sensor, Compressed Raw Recording, and a maximum video resolution of 4608 x 2592 are just a few reasons why this camera is a great choice, but its downsides include the below-average performance in low light conditions and no ND filters.</p><hr><h4 id="3-Nikon-D500"><a href="#3-Nikon-D500" class="headerlink" title="3.

Needless to say, Nikon D500 supports 4K UHD video recording at 30, 25 and 24 FPS frame rates. Perhaps the biggest flaw of this camera is its price because at $1,996.95 it is one of the most expensive APS-C DSLR cameras on the market.

EOS 5D Mark IV isn’t just an excellent choice for photographers, but for videographers as well. The video options are enhanced by the addition of Dual Pixel CMOS AF and Movie Servo AF that help shooter control focus with ease. The camera can shoot 4K videos at 30FPS and it can capture still frames at an amazing 8.8MP.

The battery life is estimated at 320 shots, but it is probably a good idea to get a battery grip to ensure that your camera is working if you need to shoot video with over a longer period of time.</p><hr><h4 id="5-Fuji-X-T2"><a href="#5-Fuji-X-T2" class="headerlink" title="5.

Since its release in early September 2016, the X-T2 model has established itself as one of the best mirrorless cameras on the market. The X-Processor Pro Engine, 24.3MP APS-C X-Trans CMOS III Sensor, and the dual SD card slots enable the users to create breathtaking material almost effortlessly. The camera produces 4K footage at 30 FPS with a maximum resolution of 3840×2160 pixels. It is hard to find a downside to this camera, and if there is one it is the absence of a touch screen. Fuji X-T2 will delight both amateurs and professionals as it is easy to operate and it provides the high-end performance.</p><hr><h3 id="Part-3-5-Best-4K-Action-Cameras"><a href="#Part-3-5-Best-4K-Action-Cameras" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: 5 Best 4K Action Cameras"></a>Part 3: 5 Best 4K Action Cameras</h3><h4 id="1-Yi-4k-Plus"><a href="#1-Yi-4k-Plus" class="headerlink" title="1.

I make sure that i made my video different from others, straight to the point and always with the result of the product.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/create-quality-video-content.jpg"                      alt="create quality video content"                ></p><h3 id="YouTube-Collab-To-Other-Content-Creator"><a href="#YouTube-Collab-To-Other-Content-Creator" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Collab To Other Content Creator"></a>YouTube Collab To Other Content Creator</h3><p>Because collaboration benefits everyone, working with influencer is a great way to get in front of potential subscriber to your channel.

Both of these are compared in detail as below:</p><h4 id="1-Hardware"><a href="#1-Hardware" class="headerlink" title="1.Hardware"></a>1.Hardware</h4><p><strong>Touch Screen:</strong> When displays of both these cameras are compared then it was observed that YI 4K provides better response as compared to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >GoPro Hero5 Black <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Size of display is also larger in case of YI 4K as it goes up to 2.19” whereas Hero5 has 2” screen. The Touch Screen is found more interactive in YI 4K whereas in case of Hero5 you may need to press twice especially when it is wet. The front LCD display of GoPro provides additional settings menu for easy control.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/yi-4k-touchscreen.jpg"                      alt="Yi 4K action camera touchscreen"                ></p><p> Image source:elproducente.com</p><p><strong>Waterproof:</strong> The biggest benefit of GoPro Hero5 is that it can serve you underwater but YI 4K cannot as you need additional protective case for this camera. But you cannot save your recordings from handling noise in case of GoPro unit. When you go underwater with YI 4K while using protective housing then it is not possible to use its touch screen feature and secondly the audio quality decays by large extent.</p><p><strong>Battery Life:</strong> Both of these camera units come with removable batteries but in case of Hero5 you can enjoy recording only up to 1hr 40 minutes with its 1220mAh battery backup whereas the YI 4K camera is developed with 1400mAh battery that can serve perfectly for 2 hours. Prefer to use these cameras with WiFi connections turned off in order to save battery for longer duration.</p><h4 id="2-Performance"><a href="#2-Performance" class="headerlink" title="2.Performance"></a>2.Performance</h4><p><strong>Image Resolution:</strong> Photo quality of both cameras is 12MP and digital image stabilization feature is added to both units. You can find much warmer and smoother quality with Yi 4K whereas GoPro offers services for RAW photography.</p><p><strong>Video Resolution:</strong> When we talk about the video resolution then different ratings must be compared to get better idea about performance. When we talk about Go Pro Hero5 then maximum video quality is offered to be 4K at 30fps, 2.7k at 60fps, 1080p with 120fps and 720p at 240fps. On the other side in case of Xiaomi YI 4K you will be able to avail 4K at 30fps, 2.5K at 30fps, 1440p with 60fps, 1080p for 120fps and 720p with 200fps only.</p><p><strong>Audio Quality:</strong> Audio Quality of GoPro Hero5 is rated to be much superior as compared to Yi 4K camera unit. The housing helps to protect Hero5 from wind noise but it can perform even better without housing as compared to Yi 4K. Hero5 Black comes with 3 microphones and it helps to make better selection for audio streams.</p><p><strong>Price:</strong> GoPro Hero5 can be ordered online with a payment of $399 but you will be glad to know that equally featured Xiaomi Yi Action Camera is cheaper as well as affordable with a price tag of $199.99 only.

Auto Synchronization tool.</strong><br>Usually, when you shoot a video from a little farther apart, the voice will be very low and there will be a lot of noise hence very less sound will be recorded properly. To avoid audio issues, we try to take a cell phone in our pocket or hand and the distance of the camera does not affect the video and audio. Especially in prank videos, people have hidden cameras which is difficult to record proper audio. For this, we use a cell phone to record audio separately and video separately.<br>Can you imagine how difficult it is to sync audio with video?<br>Filmora has made it much easy. Filmora provides you with the <strong>Auto Synchronization</strong> feature in which you can join video and audio together.<br>At last put <strong>auto synchronization on.</strong> It will automatically synchronize and adjust the audio according to the video.

Stock Audio in Filmora.</strong><br>Many people use background music in their videos, especially vloggers and travel videos so it is difficult for them to find royalty-free music to avoid <strong>copyright claims</strong>.

But you cannot save your recordings from handling noise in case of GoPro unit. When you go underwater with YI 4K while using protective housing then it is not possible to use its touch screen feature and secondly the audio quality decays by large extent.</p><p><strong>Battery Life:</strong> Both of these camera units come with removable batteries but in case of Hero5 you can enjoy recording only up to 1hr 40 minutes with its 1220mAh battery backup whereas the YI 4K camera is developed with 1400mAh battery that can serve perfectly for 2 hours. Prefer to use these cameras with WiFi connections turned off in order to save battery for longer duration.</p><h4 id="2-Performance"><a href="#2-Performance" class="headerlink" title="2.Performance"></a>2.Performance</h4><p><strong>Image Resolution:</strong> Photo quality of both cameras is 12MP and digital image stabilization feature is added to both units. You can find much warmer and smoother quality with Yi 4K whereas GoPro offers services for RAW photography.</p><p><strong>Video Resolution:</strong> When we talk about the video resolution then different ratings must be compared to get better idea about performance. When we talk about Go Pro Hero5 then maximum video quality is offered to be 4K at 30fps, 2.7k at 60fps, 1080p with 120fps and 720p at 240fps. On the other side in case of Xiaomi YI 4K you will be able to avail 4K at 30fps, 2.5K at 30fps, 1440p with 60fps, 1080p for 120fps and 720p with 200fps only.</p><p><strong>Audio Quality:</strong> Audio Quality of GoPro Hero5 is rated to be much superior as compared to Yi 4K camera unit. The housing helps to protect Hero5 from wind noise but it can perform even better without housing as compared to Yi 4K. Hero5 Black comes with 3 microphones and it helps to make better selection for audio streams.</p><p><strong>Price:</strong> GoPro Hero5 can be ordered online with a payment of $399 but you will be glad to know that equally featured Xiaomi Yi Action Camera is cheaper as well as affordable with a price tag of $199.99 only. When we compare specs and hardware of both these cameras then Yi 4K is observed to provide all desired high performance results while meeting all needs of sports persons so you can think of buying Xiaomi product that falls in your budget.</p><h4 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h4><p> Almost all features are discussed above and it is observed that if you are searching for a camera to record videos underwater or in rainy seasons then it is best idea to invest on GoPro Hero5 but in case of other adventurous sports activities Yi 4K can also provide you impressive results and it is a fit to budget camera unit. The Video and Photo quality is almost similar for both units but the battery backup of Yi 4K is again better then GoPro unit. So it is better to decide your budget and needs first and then pick the right camera unit for you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-comprehensive-hdr-mastery-for-breathtaking-portraits/"><u>[New] In 2024, Comprehensive HDR Mastery for Breathtaking Portraits</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/2024-approved-amplify-your-voice-on-twitter-top-video-uploading-solutions/"><u>2024 Approved  Amplify Your Voice on Twitter  Top Video Uploading Solutions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/2024-approved-elevate-your-videos-mastering-the-art-of-srt-in-mp4/"><u>2024 Approved  Elevate Your Videos  Mastering the Art of SRT in MP4</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/excellent-typography-trick-sets-for-2024/"><u>Excellent Typography Trick Sets for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-laughterlink-join-now-and-start-your-journey/"><u>[New] LaughterLink  Join Now & Start Your Journey</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-compatibility-score-which-phones-work-with-gear-vr/"><u>[Updated] Compatibility Score  Which Phones Work with Gear VR?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-easy-tweaks-changing-fishy-vocal-patterns-on-windows/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Easy Tweaks  Changing Fishy Vocal Patterns on Windows</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-topics.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-what-is-an-ai-avatar/"><u>New In 2024, What Is an AI Avatar?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/updated-expert-reviews-best-game-capture-apps/"><u>[Updated] Expert Reviews  Best Game Capture Apps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-translation.techidaily.com/updated-translate-instagram-videos-easily-a-step-by-step-guide-for-2024/"><u>Updated Translate Instagram Videos Easily A Step-by-Step Guide for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/2024-approved-communication-mastery-for-impactful-interviews/"><u>2024 Approved  Communication Mastery  For Impactful Interviews</u></a></li><li><a href="https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/ipogo-will-be-the-new-ispoofer-on-honor-70-lite-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>iPogo will be the new iSpoofer On Honor 70 Lite 5G? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-restore-deleted-motorola-edge-40-neo-contacts-an-easy-method-explained-by-fonelab-android-recover-contacts/"><u>How to Restore Deleted Motorola Edge 40 Neo Contacts  An Easy Method Explained.</u></a></li><li><a href="https://smart-video-creator.techidaily.com/new-neon-text-maker-top-picks-for-creating-eye-catching-designs/"><u>New Neon Text Maker Top Picks for Creating Eye-Catching Designs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/updated-fusiontv-services-international-and-home-viewing-unite/"><u>[Updated] FusionTV Services  International & Home Viewing Unite</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/updated-enhanced-mac-technology-video-plus-sound-record-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Enhanced Mac Technology  Video + Sound Record for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

That’s a great idea! Giveaways are a great way to engage with your fans and followers, and they can also help to promote your business. But before you start posting about your giveaway, there are a few things you need to keep in mind. Here are some tips for running a successful Facebook giveaway.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Choose-a-giveaway-prize-that-is-relevant-to-your-target-audience"><a href="#Part-1-Choose-a-giveaway-prize-that-is-relevant-to-your-target-audience" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

It’ll make them more likely to enter the giveaway, and more likely to remember your brand down the line. Plus, it’ll show that you’re tuned into their interests - always a plus in the eyes of potential customers.
