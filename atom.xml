    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Optic-Oasis-Discover-the-Top-10-Lenses"><a href="#Optic-Oasis-Discover-the-Top-10-Lenses" class="headerlink" title="Optic Oasis: Discover the Top 10 Lenses"></a>Optic Oasis: Discover the Top 10 Lenses</h2><p>One of the first creative choices made during the photographic process is choosing a camera lens. There are a seemingly limitless number of alternatives available, and your decision will have a significant impact on your photos. The introduction of mirrorless prompted the demand for lenses that matched the new formats.</p><p>Initially, while manufacturers like Canon, Fuji, Nikon, Olympus, Panasonic, and Sony expanded their line of native lenses for those formats, photographers were dependent on adapters to fit legacy lenses from brands like Canon and Nikon to the APS-C, full-frame, and micro four-thirds mirrorless cameras. Additionally, independent lens producers like Sigma and Tamron continue to be crucial in supplying the demands of photographers looking for the greatest camera lens. Let’s start off!</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="1-What-should-you-look-for-when-buying-a-lens"><a href="#1-What-should-you-look-for-when-buying-a-lens" class="headerlink" title="1. What should you look for when buying a lens?"></a>1. What should you look for when buying a lens?</h2><p>There are a number of factors to think about while looking for the best camera lens. Knowing how you’ll use the lens is just as crucial as ensuring sure it’s available and compatible with your camera’s mount (or that an adapter is available). Are you trying to find the best portrait lens? Or perhaps you’re looking for the best lens for landscape photography. Or maybe you prefer taking pictures of little objects, in which case you’ll need a macro lens. There are (nearly) universal, all-encompassing circumstances, of course. Just keep in mind that neither the greatest lens for landscape photography nor the finest lens for astrophotography will inevitably be the ideal choice for macro photography.</p><p>Regardless of the lens you select, the effective focal length’s relationship to the sensor size is a crucial consideration. Because the sensor on full-frame cameras is the same size as a 35mm film strip, this is not a problem. However, you must consider the crop factor if you’re using an APS-C or micro four thirds camera. A 100mm lens will provide a field of view of 150mm when used with an APS-C camera, which will crop the frame by 1.5x or 1.6x (depending on the model) (35mm equivalent). It simply captures a smaller portion of the image produced by the lens, giving the impression that the image is zoomed in. The effective focal length will double with a micro four thirds sensor, giving a 100mm lens a 200mm (35mm equivalent) field of view. This is typically not an issue with telephoto lenses because you want a larger focal length, but it’s crucial to keep in mind with wide-angle lenses so make sure to conduct some calculations before choosing one.</p><p>The cost of a camera lens is affected by some aspects. A lens with a quicker (lower f-number) maximum aperture will cost more than one with f&#x2F;stops that start with a slower maximum aperture, such f&#x2F;3.5. For longer, heavier lenses, optical image stabilization—also known as SteadyShot, vibration reduction, or simply OIS or OS—is crucial. Invisible elements like the caliber of the glass, the kinds of coatings used on the surfaces, and the weather sealing are also important.</p><p>In the absence of other factors, some minor extras like the presence of a lens hood, a manual aperture ring, a carrying case, and other bonuses may influence your decision. but shouldn’t determine the outcome of your decision.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Nl0Z0eth1u4?si=0eecOBNfc--51AJO" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-What-are-some-good-and-robust-lenses"><a href="#2-What-are-some-good-and-robust-lenses" class="headerlink" title="2. What are some good and robust lenses?"></a>2. What are some good and robust lenses?</h2><p>Focal length is one of the most important factors for picking the best camera lens and producing a nice photo while taking portraits of individuals or even very small groups. Generally speaking, a short telephoto lens is good, especially for tight compositions (headshots, waist level&#x2F;head and shoulders, etc.)—an 85mm or 105mm, for instance. If you can’t back up and shoot wide, you might want to go as wide as 70mm or 50mm for full-body and larger group images in order to minimize distortion.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AcAYRX0cwwA?si=DxqWU39vqksZbe1s" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Nikon-Z-14-24mm-f-2-8-S"><a href="#Nikon-Z-14-24mm-f-2-8-S" class="headerlink" title="Nikon Z 14-24mm f&#x2F;2.8 S"></a><strong>Nikon Z 14-24mm f&#x2F;2.8 S</strong></h3><p>The premium Z 14-24mm f&#x2F;2.8 S lens, made for full-frame Nikon Z-series cameras, offers superb edge-to-edge sharpness for landscape photography. The aspherical lenses on the small lens are perfect for maintaining the sharpness of stars and city lights. Additionally, there are two ways to install filters: a slot for filter sheets and gels at the back and 112mm filters that may be screwed into the front.</p><p>Other choices for ultra-wide-angle lenses for full-frame cameras include the Sony FE 12-24mm f&#x2F;2.8 G Master. This camera lens is intriguing, albeit expensive, because it offers a little extra coverage starting at 12mm and maintains a consistent aperture throughout the zoom.</p><p>The 14–24mm f&#x2F;2.8 art series lens from Sigma is available in two variations. One is for DSLRs from Canon or Nikon, while the other is for mirrorless cameras from Sony and L-mount.</p><h3 id="Zeiss-Milvus-21mm-f-2-8"><a href="#Zeiss-Milvus-21mm-f-2-8" class="headerlink" title="Zeiss Milvus 21mm f&#x2F;2.8"></a><strong>Zeiss Milvus 21mm f&#x2F;2.8</strong></h3><p>The Zeiss Milvus 21mm f&#x2F;2.8 is the first lens up, a costly manual focus prime lens with a small but devoted fan base. The only true bells and whistles this lens has are the “Zeiss” moniker, and I’m sure many photographers wonder if it lives up to the $1843 price tag in any other manner.</p><p>I must admit that I would never purchase this lens for myself, but to me, it does. Nevertheless, it is one of the sharpest wide angles I’ve ever tested, and unlike many of the other lenses on this list, it accepts filters (82mm size).</p><h3 id="Sigma-60-600mm-f-4-5-6-3"><a href="#Sigma-60-600mm-f-4-5-6-3" class="headerlink" title="Sigma 60-600mm f&#x2F;4.5-6.3"></a><strong>Sigma 60-600mm f&#x2F;4.5-6.3</strong></h3><p>This 60-600mm super telephoto zoom is perfect for wildlife since it is wide enough to capture visitors to the bird feeder outside your back door or a pod of dolphins surfing the bow waves of a boat while still being long enough to capture the most elusive lioness and her pups on a picture safari. This image-stabilized lens, which is offered for Nikon, Canon, and Sigma, includes a tripod collar and is dust- and splash-proof.</p><p>The Sony FE 200-600mm f&#x2F;5.6 has Sony’s outstanding SteadyShot image stabilization, making it a great lens for Sony photographers. Although we typically advise zooms for wildlife photography, don’t discount some of the primes available. For instance, Canon’s EOS R mirrorless system is compatible with the Canon RF600mm f&#x2F;11 IS STM lens. Even though it only has an f&#x2F;11 maximum aperture, it should still function properly in well-lit environments.</p><p>Although you might need to increase the ISO to obtain a quick shutter speed, this lens is less expensive than other extreme telephoto lenses.</p><h3 id="Rokinon-14mm-f-2-4"><a href="#Rokinon-14mm-f-2-4" class="headerlink" title="Rokinon 14mm f&#x2F;2.4"></a><strong>Rokinon 14mm f&#x2F;2.4</strong></h3><p>For a couple reasons, I chose the lesser-known Rokinon 14mm f&#x2F;2.4 lens over the Sigma 14mm f&#x2F;1.8. First, it costs half as much ($800) and is substantially lighter (719 vs. 1170 grams). These two elements alone make this lens more appealing to many photographers.</p><p>Second, the Rokinon 14mm f&#x2F;2.4 has outstanding image quality. When I used it, I didn’t get a chance to directly compare it to the Sigma 14mm f&#x2F;1.8, but I did evaluate how it performed when I photographed the Milky Way, which is likely the most demanding scenario. I accomplished this by comparing it to four other top 14mm lenses. With virtually no coma and perfect sharpness even when wide open, it defeated all of them.</p><p>This is a fantastic option for shooting landscapes in addition to stars. Although it lacks autofocus, the 14mm focal length makes it either the best or second-best lens on our list in terms of image quality. And once more, the Sigma 14mm f&#x2F;1.8, which is the closest rival in that sense, is twice as expensive.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gMS5pm0SQlQ?si=gasOo6p2agrVlIb7" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Tamron-15-30mm-f-2-8"><a href="#Tamron-15-30mm-f-2-8" class="headerlink" title="Tamron 15-30mm f&#x2F;2.8"></a><strong>Tamron 15-30mm f&#x2F;2.8</strong></h3><p>The Tamron 15-30mm f&#x2F;2.8 is one of my favorite wide-angle lenses that I’ve ever used. Although it is weighty, the Nikon 14-24mm f&#x2F;2.8 matches or even outperforms it in terms of overall image quality. It also comes with some contemporary features, such as vibration reduction and a front element that repels water. The telephoto range is where it loses some strength, like the Nikon (see our review), but even there it performs better than others.</p><p>The pricing is the actual incentive to get this lens instead. Additionally, there is a previous model with nearly comparable image quality that is available for even better used pricing. It costs $1200 new and even less used.</p><p>Tamron lenses don’t extend all the way to 14mm (closer to 15.5mm instead). Although the increase in focal length to 30mm is good, we believe that most of this lens’ potential customers would be more interested in the wide end of things. Additionally, similar to the Nikon 14-24mm f&#x2F;2.8, it doesn’t come with built-in filter support, so if that’s crucial to your photography, you’ll need a hefty attachment.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/15TKQ-BOENI?si=Ri4B2AuxAdi0Bglz" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Tamron-17-35mm-f-2-8-4"><a href="#Tamron-17-35mm-f-2-8-4" class="headerlink" title="Tamron 17-35mm f&#x2F;2.8-4"></a><strong>Tamron 17-35mm f&#x2F;2.8-4</strong></h3><p>This lens is a recent addition to our list, and several people have asked why I didn’t include it in the comments. I’ve only lately had a chance to really test the Tamron 17-35mm f&#x2F;2.8-4, and I think it’s a great lens. First of all, it offers an excellent price of $600 and excellent image quality.</p><p>It is lightweight and has an f&#x2F;2.8 maximum aperture, making it ideal for astrophotography. This all comes together to provide a pretty remarkable package. In spite of the fact that corner sharpness isn’t nearly as good as it could be compared to certain other lenses on this list, the Tamron 17-35mm f&#x2F;2.8-4 doesn’t really have many drawbacks to speak about. But that’s hardly a criticism of this lens. It’s one of the first I’d look at if I needed a wide-angle zoom for a Nikon.</p><h3 id="Nikon-20mm-f-1-8"><a href="#Nikon-20mm-f-1-8" class="headerlink" title="Nikon 20mm f&#x2F;1.8"></a><strong>Nikon 20mm f&#x2F;1.8</strong></h3><p>It is sharper than all of the zooms on this list at 20mm, with the possible exception of the 14-30mm f&#x2F;4. And assuming you don’t require the 14mm focal length for your Milky Way work, it’s better than practically every lens above for astrophotography thanks to its f&#x2F;1.8 aperture.</p><h2 id="3-What-lenses-are-good-for-nighttime"><a href="#3-What-lenses-are-good-for-nighttime" class="headerlink" title="3. What lenses are good for nighttime?"></a>3. What lenses are good for nighttime?</h2><p>Most photographers find nighttime photography challenging because this particular shooting circumstance frequently depends on your lens’ capacity to pick up light. abundant light As a result, investing in the ideal equipment that makes the most of any available ambient light and illuminates your entire frame is essential for success.</p><p>Here is our list on the top nighttime camera lenses to help you capture the darkest of scenes.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UJJbj1vbzs8?si=X3zd8thLJKprfuEa" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Canon-EF-24-70mm-f-2-8L-II-USM"><a href="#Canon-EF-24-70mm-f-2-8L-II-USM" class="headerlink" title="Canon EF 24-70mm f&#x2F;2.8L II USM"></a><strong>Canon EF 24-70mm f&#x2F;2.8L II USM</strong></h3><p>For general photography, one of the greatest lenses is the Canon EF 24-70mm f&#x2F;2.8L II USM. This has an excellent build quality and a quick f&#x2F;2.8 aperture, which are its biggest advantages.</p><p>This focus range, also known as the “walk-around lens,” may be used to shoot whatever you could possibly want, including tight portraits and landscapes. The f&#x2F;1.8 lenses that we described at the beginning of this post are one stop slower than f&#x2F;2.8. However, the Canon 24-70mm f&#x2F;2.8L II has a number of qualities that make it a fantastic lens for shooting in low light.</p><h3 id="Sigma-35mm-f-1-2-DG-DN-Art-Lens"><a href="#Sigma-35mm-f-1-2-DG-DN-Art-Lens" class="headerlink" title="Sigma 35mm f&#x2F;1.2 DG DN Art Lens"></a><strong>Sigma 35mm f&#x2F;1.2 DG DN Art Lens</strong></h3><p>Amazing glass is the Sigma 35mm f&#x2F;1.2 DG DN Art Lens. With a maximum aperture of f&#x2F;1.2, the widest an autofocusing lens can go, it offers excellent results. Since the lens includes a floating mechanism, focusing up close as well as throughout the remainder of the focusing range will be simple.</p><p>One “F” Low Dispersion Element, also known as a FLD element, and four Super-Low Dispersion glass elements make up the lens. This substance functions very similarly to a fluorite coating. There are also two spherical components. Together, these components make sure that chromatic aberration and distortion are minimized in the lens.</p><p>The lens also features a Super-Multi-Layer coating on top of it. This reduces flares and ghosting while enhancing the image’s sharpness and saturation. The Sigma 35mm f&#x2F;1.4 DG HSM Art lens is available for DSLR cameras, although it is only available for mirrorless systems.</p><h3 id="Sony-FE-14mm-f-1-8-GM-Lens"><a href="#Sony-FE-14mm-f-1-8-GM-Lens" class="headerlink" title="Sony FE 14mm f&#x2F;1.8 GM Lens"></a><strong>Sony FE 14mm f&#x2F;1.8 GM Lens</strong></h3><p>The Sony FE 14mm f&#x2F;1.8 GM Lens is the last item on our list, but surely not the least! The G-Master is your best pal if you own a Sony mirrorless camera. The most expensive lenses you can purchase directly from Sony are in their GM range, which includes the well-liked Sony FE 14mm f&#x2F;1.8 GM Lens.</p><p>This lens’s wide focal length and fantastic f&#x2F;1.8 aperture make it a handy tool for astrophotography. Edge-to- edge sharpness means that the stars you photograph in the corners of the frame will be just as sharp as those that appear in the center of the picture.</p><p>Sharpness is second nature to this GM lens. Neon fringing can be prevented from occurring in the areas of your image that are contrasted by having good chromatic aberration management. This one feels quite cozy in your palm because to the ergonomic lens design.</p><h3 id="Nikon-AF-Nikkor-50mm-f-1-8D"><a href="#Nikon-AF-Nikkor-50mm-f-1-8D" class="headerlink" title="Nikon AF Nikkor 50mm f&#x2F;1.8D"></a><strong>Nikon AF Nikkor 50mm f&#x2F;1.8D</strong></h3><p>Among Nikonians, the Nikon AF Nikkor 50mm f&#x2F;1.8 F-mount lens is a perennial favorite. This 50mm prime lens has an f&#x2F;1.8 maximum wide aperture. The lens has an aperture ring, a focus distance indication, and a manual focus ring.Flares and ghosting are handled by the lens’ Super Integrated Coating. The 50mm is versatile since it has a physical ring that regulates the aperture and a manual focusing ring.</p><h2 id="4-What-are-good-micro-lenses"><a href="#4-What-are-good-micro-lenses" class="headerlink" title="4. What are good micro lenses?"></a>4. What are good micro lenses?</h2><p>Using the best macro lenses, photographers can make a little world full of hidden beauty visible. Macro lenses provide close-ups and magnification that would not be feasible without their specialized optical design, opening up a wide range of photographic opportunities for teeny-tiny plants and animals</p><p>Additionally, macro lenses aren’t just useful for this; they also make great prime lenses in general and work especially well for portrait photography. You are purchasing more than just the capacity to photograph close-ups when you take into account the price tags of these lenses.</p><h3 id="Canon-EF-100mm-f-2-8L-Macro-IS-USM"><a href="#Canon-EF-100mm-f-2-8L-Macro-IS-USM" class="headerlink" title="Canon EF 100mm f&#x2F;2.8L Macro IS USM"></a><strong>Canon EF 100mm f&#x2F;2.8L Macro IS USM</strong></h3><p>Canon’s 100mm macro lens has hybrid optical stabilization in addition to the strong L-series build quality. Ring- type ultrasonic autofocus and a three-position autofocus limiter switch, which can shut off the short or long end of the range, are typical high-end attractions.</p><p>The lens also contains an Ultra-low Dispersion element and weather sealing. Even at f&#x2F;22, image quality is superb throughout the whole aperture range, allowing you to squeeze out a bit extra depth of field. For the majority of macro photography, the manual focus ring is more crucial than the autofocus since it is smooth and precise.</p><h3 id="Tokina-atx-i-100mm-F2-8-FF-Macro"><a href="#Tokina-atx-i-100mm-F2-8-FF-Macro" class="headerlink" title="Tokina atx-i 100mm F2.8 FF Macro"></a><strong>Tokina atx-i 100mm F2.8 FF Macro</strong></h3><p>The AT-X PRO 100mm macro lens from Tokina was introduced back in 2006. In 2019, the replacement atx-i (interactive) model hit the market with a new design that gives the lens a more modern appearance. However, appearances can be deceiving, because the newcomer uses the same optical path with two aspherical and two Super-Low Dispersion glass elements as the original.</p><p>The fact that only the Canon mount version includes an autofocus motor and that it has an expanding inner barrel that extends longer at closer focusing distances are other similarities. The image quality is excellent, with outstanding sharpness levels, little distortion, and barely detectable lateral chromatic aberration.</p><h3 id="Nikon-Z-MC-105mm-f-2-8-VR-S"><a href="#Nikon-Z-MC-105mm-f-2-8-VR-S" class="headerlink" title="Nikon Z MC 105mm f&#x2F;2.8 VR S"></a><strong>Nikon Z MC 105mm f&#x2F;2.8 VR S</strong></h3><p>One of two new Z-mount macro lenses is the MC 105mm from Nikon. There is also the more affordable Z MC 50mm f&#x2F;2.8, which is a good lens, but the MC 105mm has a better macro photography focal length and is a pro-grade lens, so it’s well worth the extra money.</p><p>A super-fast and very accurate autofocus mechanism, together with highly effective optical VR (Vibration Reduction) that can function in conjunction with the in - body stabilizers of Nikon’s full-frame Z-series cameras, provide sublime image quality for both general shooting and extreme close-ups. A multi-function OLED display, a lens-function button and control ring that can be customized, an autofocus range limiter, as well as an electronically connected focus ring that permits ultra-fine adjustments, are all features of the handling exotica camera.</p><h3 id="Nikon-AF-S-105mm-f-2-8-G-IF-ED-VR-Micro"><a href="#Nikon-AF-S-105mm-f-2-8-G-IF-ED-VR-Micro" class="headerlink" title="Nikon AF-S 105mm f&#x2F;2.8 G IF ED VR Micro"></a><strong>Nikon AF-S 105mm f&#x2F;2.8 G IF ED VR Micro</strong></h3><p>This is Nikon’s top-tier FX format macro lens, yet it also works well with DX cameras when photographing up close. It has a ring-type ultrasonic autofocus mechanism with entirely internal focusing, 3-stop VR II stabilization, and Nano Crystal coating, just like the 85mm DX lens in the group. The optical pathways of both lenses have 14 elements total, including one ED element.</p><p>The 105mm has a greater diameter because FX format lenses must produce a larger image circle to cover the larger picture sensor. At the minimum focus setting, the working distance between the front of the lens and the subject is fairly similar to the DX lens at 14.5cm. Similar to the Sigma lens, the VR system is effective for usual shooting, although it performs less well for close-up shots than the hybrid stabilizers from Tamron and Canon.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iOVkXoUxLf4?si=QfC18T2cb5OkiaXo" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="5-What-are-the-price-ranges"><a href="#5-What-are-the-price-ranges" class="headerlink" title="5.

In case of Gear 360 you will be able to enjoy 4K resolution whereas LG 360 serves with 2K resolution only thus <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Samsung Gear 360 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> will be better choice in this case. On the other side if we talk about audio abilities then LG360 has an edge over Samsung Gear 360 because of its ability to record 5.1 level surround sounds that is major requirement of a 360 degree video. The Gear 360 possess stereo record feature that can capture voice only in two directions thus resultant audio in scenes is not that much clear. Moving forward to more technical specifications, the bit rate – well known as quality of image with resolution is 60MB&#x2F;second in case of Gear 360 whereas LG360 cam limits up to 19MB&#x2F;second, this makes a big difference in quality. If we count features then Samsung gear 360 definitely have more features as like its waterproof body, highly stabilized video results and F2.0 dual lenses but LG360 lacks behind in these features.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8dH3yHH9IX8?si=geiW5KbIljSFT9pz" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-Editing-software-comparison-comparison"><a href="#Part-4-Editing-software-comparison-comparison" class="headerlink" title="Part 4 Editing software comparison comparison"></a>Part 4 Editing software comparison comparison</h2><p>It is possible to stitch videos as well as photographs taken from the 360 degree camera using Galaxy phone and they can be directly shared on social media. Some consumers also love to use Desktop software to edit the camera results in detail. Same as like Gear 360, the latest device from LG can also capture good quality 360 degree videos as well as photographs but it do not support spherical share as like Samsung unit. You can pair up LG360 cam only with LG G5 latest smartphone whereas video and photo editing options are not yet known for smartphone as well as PC. Both these devices come with Wi-Fi connectivity, USB port and Bluetooth capabilities whereas in case of Samsung 360 gear NFC is an additional option. The ultimate combination of time lapse recording, 360 spherical recording and loop recording makes everything easy in Samsung gear where you can avail wonderful results for each real time recording.</p><p>Check this side-by-side video review to know more about this two 360 degree cameras:</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XoC2TGp1PLY?si=iH9xs76NhWn4pP-E" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-5-Conclusion"><a href="#Part-5-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Part 5 Conclusion"></a>Part 5 Conclusion</h2><p>Price difference of both devices is well reflected in the comparison table above and you got enough information about their features too. The gear 360 results better looking images along with better color distributions but in case of LG the image as well as video quality is comparatively degraded; Although, LG cam is much faster and discrete design but for professional photographers it will not result better output. The two additional shooting modes of Gear 360 also allows better quality of videos and its compatibility with Samsung smartphones allows easy editing and uploading. After getting real time users recommendations and their reviews, users are advised to prefer Samsung GEAR 360 for their Virtual Reality needs but those who cannot compromise for price range can go for LG360 device as its audio quality is much better than Samsung gear 360 along with ability to connect with Android as well as iOS devices.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nlwr9LjJ-ng?si=I6UNAtfBkY2FTceu" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Benjamin Arango</p><p>Benjamin Arango is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Benjamin Arango</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-elevate-your-images-learn-photo-curvature-in-ps/"><u>[New] In 2024, Elevate Your Images Learn Photo Curvature in PS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-securing-privacy-efficient-blur-techniques-in-images/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Securing Privacy Efficient Blur Techniques in Images</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/updated-subtlety-at-the-helm-lowering-sound-intensity-in-fl-studio/"><u>[Updated] Subtlety at the Helm Lowering Sound Intensity in FL Studio</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/updated-unending-chats-strategies-for-continuous-snapstreaks-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Unending Chats - Strategies for Continuous Snapstreaks for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/8-dall-e-3-prompts-for-your-next-image/"><u>8 DALL-E 3 Prompts for Your Next Image</u></a></li><li><a href="https://common-error.techidaily.com/best-methods-to-unfreeze-your-windows-10-desktop-bar-a-guide/"><u>Best Methods to Unfreeze Your Windows 10 Desktop Bar: A Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/gif-to-sticker-guide-mastering-conversion-on-discord-whatsapp-telegram-for-2024/"><u>GIF to Sticker Guide Mastering Conversion on Discord, WhatsApp, Telegram for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/how-to-blur-a-picture-on-iphone-4-ways/"><u>How to Blur a Picture on iPhone [4 Ways]</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/in-2024-cutting-edge-ergonomic-innovations-transforming-workspaces-today/"><u>In 2024, Cutting-Edge Ergonomic Innovations Transforming Workspaces Today</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/in-2024-peering-into-the-future-with-asuss-4k-uxga-mg28uq-screen/"><u>In 2024, Peering Into the Future with ASUS's 4K UXGA MG28UQ Screen</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-secrets-to-earning-facebooks-status-symbol-blue/"><u>In 2024, Secrets to Earning Facebook’s Status Symbol (Blue)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/virtualitys-voyage-an-overview/"><u>Virtuality’s Voyage An Overview</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-revival.techidaily.com/1726228190862-avi-m4a-movavi/"><u>오늘날의 가장 유용한 무료 AVI 크리펫: M4A 변환을 위해 Movavi를 사용</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

There are many different LUTs, and each one does its specific task. Today we will discuss the <strong>top ten</strong> most usually used <strong>LUTs</strong> with their functions and <strong>free download links</strong>. Let’s start!</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-Why-should-we-use-preset-LUTs"><a href="#Part-1-Why-should-we-use-preset-LUTs" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

Why should we use preset LUTs?</h2><p>In addition to supporting a video to connect with audiences and emphasize the plot, color is also the most natural method for viewers to perceive a piece of media. A movie’s aesthetic potential will be severely constrained if it only uses original camera footage. Every video producer has to be able to accurately comprehend the emotional qualities of color in order to adapt to the specific color theme of the movie.

So, here are some background information on graphics cards.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xIP8ktrmOdg?si=zRnjbGzM6PDx2jCq" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="What-is-a-Graphics-Card"><a href="#What-is-a-Graphics-Card" class="headerlink" title="What is a Graphics Card?"></a>What is a Graphics Card?</h3><p>A graphics card or a video card is a piece of computer hardware that produces the steam of output images you can see on a computer’s monitor or any other display device. All computers feature a graphics card because without them it would be impossible to run even the most basic applications like word processors or web browsers.</p><h3 id="What-are-the-Most-Common-Types-of-Graphics-Cards"><a href="#What-are-the-Most-Common-Types-of-Graphics-Cards" class="headerlink" title="What are the Most Common Types of Graphics Cards?"></a>What are the Most Common Types of Graphics Cards?</h3><p>There are two common types of graphics cards. Most computers have an <strong>integrated graphics card</strong> that is located on the same chip as the CPU, which enables you to edit photos, watch and edit videos or play video games. However, GPUs and CPUs that are located on the same chip often limit each other’s capabilities, and as a result, the computer needs more time to perform demanding tasks.</p><p>Installing a <strong>dedicated graphics card</strong> to your computer will eliminate lagging and it will allow you to edit videos in high resolution faster or reduce the amount of time that is required to render a 4K video. All dedicated graphics cards come with a separate chip and a separate RAM that reduces the strain of a computer’s CPU and minimizes the lagging of the footage during the video editing process.</p><p>Whether or not getting a dedicated graphics card will prove to be a good investment depends on the tasks you perform regularly on your computer. If you only edit photos and videos at a basic level, then the integrated graphics card is all you need.</p><p>Nonetheless, if you are a professional animator, video editor or simply want to play all the latest games in maximum resolution, a dedicated graphics card is going to make routine tasks you perform on your computer every day much easier and faster.</p><h3 id="Which-Factors-to-Consider-While-Choosing-a-Graphics-Card"><a href="#Which-Factors-to-Consider-While-Choosing-a-Graphics-Card" class="headerlink" title="Which Factors to Consider While Choosing a Graphics Card?"></a>Which Factors to Consider While Choosing a Graphics Card?</h3><p>Currently, there are hundreds of different dedicated graphics card models on the market, and finding the one that is the best fit for your computer’s configuration can take some time and research. Besides checking your computer’s specifications there are a few more aspects you must consider before you purchase a dedicated graphics card.</p><h4 id="1-Power-draw"><a href="#1-Power-draw" class="headerlink" title="1. Power draw"></a>1. Power draw</h4><p>A stable power source is important for all computer configurations, as it helps you avoid system crashes and hardware malfunctions. The power usage of dedicated graphics cards varies from model to model and it can range from just 120 Watts to 300 Watts. In fact, high-end graphics cards consume as much power as all other computer components combined, and you must ensure that your computer’s power supply can provide enough power.</p><h4 id="2-Cooling"><a href="#2-Cooling" class="headerlink" title="2. Cooling"></a>2. Cooling</h4><p>Overheating can cause irreparable damage to the graphics card and to your computer, so checking the cooling capabilities of the card you would like to get can help you reduce the risk of failure in the long run. Furthermore, cooling fans on dedicated graphics cards can produce noise, and you must check if the model you’re interested in can operate at low noise levels.</p><h4 id="3-Size"><a href="#3-Size" class="headerlink" title="3. Size"></a>3. Size</h4><p>The length of most high-end dedicated graphics cards is between 10.5 and 11-inches, which can occupy two or three expansion slots. That is why you must check how many expansion slots you have at your disposal and check the size of the graphics card before you purchase it.</p><h4 id="4-Multi-card-scaling"><a href="#4-Multi-card-scaling" class="headerlink" title="4. Multi-card scaling"></a>4. Multi-card scaling</h4><p>The available space and the size can also impact your multi-card scaling options, since connecting two or more graphics cards can take a lot of space. AMD and Nvidia can be connected via CrossFire X or NVLink, but pairing graphics cards that have different architectures is not possible.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DEqoiNArwjQ?si=oaL_lgnI-RxY5Qy_" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/deal-7-video-capture-tools-for-engaging-social-media-presentations/"><u>[New] Ideal 7 Video Capture Tools for Engaging Social Media Presentations</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-acid-pro-critique-and-comparable-software/"><u>[New] In 2024, ACID Pro Critique and Comparable Software</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/updated-visualedge-7-3-elite-image-amplification-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] VisualEdge 7-3 Elite Image Amplification for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/archive-slideshow-in-high-quality-video-for-2024/"><u>Archive Slideshow in High-Quality Video for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/in-2024-10-hidden-photoshop-photo-editing-tips-for-beginners/"><u>In 2024, 10 Hidden Photoshop Photo Editing Tips for Beginners</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/24-a-step-by-step-approach-to-best-youtube-thumbnails/"><u>In 2024, A Step-by-Step Approach to Best YouTube Thumbnails</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/in-2024-change-location-on-yik-yak-for-your-oppo-reno-8t-to-enjoy-more-fun-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Change Location on Yik Yak For your Oppo Reno 8T to Enjoy More Fun | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/in-2024-mastering-movement-a-look-at-intova-x/"><u>In 2024, Mastering Movement A Look at Intova X</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/in-2024-seo-power-play-strategies-to-amplify-your-podcasts-impact/"><u>In 2024, SEO Power Play Strategies To Amplify Your Podcast's Impact</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-issues.techidaily.com/1723016833548-quick-fix-solutions-get-your-world-of-warcraft-voice-back-on-track/"><u>Quick Fix Solutions: Get Your World of Warcraft Voice Back on Track</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-clips.techidaily.com/sending-non-retwitted-videos-from-your-mobile-browser-to-twitter/"><u>Sending Non-Retwitted Videos From Your Mobile Browser to Twitter</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/streamsmart-beyond-the-dacast-shell-for-2024/"><u>StreamSmart Beyond the DaCast Shell for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/the-complete-handbook-for-telegram-web-newbies/"><u>The Complete Handbook for Telegram Web Newbies</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Our today’s topic is exciting as it’s how you can <strong>write a good documentary script</strong> for your documentary video or film. As all of us know, the script is fundamental for any screenplay as it contains all the dialogues and instructions for the actors in written form. So that’s why it is also essential for your audio or video documentaries. That’s the reason why we are going to discuss this topic here today how you can be able to write effectively.</p><ol><li><a href="#part2-1">Literary Style</a></li><li><a href="#part2-2">Shot-Oriented</a></li><li><a href="#part2-3">Shooting Script</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part3">How to make your own movie</a></li></ul><ol><li><a href="#part3-1">Ensure the authenticity of the story</a>  </li><li><a href="#part3-2">Define the key issues</a>  </li><li><a href="#part3-3">Highlight the characteristics of the scene</a>  </li><li><a href="#part3-4">Visual Writing</a>  </li><li><a href="#part3-5">Guaranteed documentary viewing (Rhythm)</a>  </li><li><a href="#part3-6">Fully researched</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part4">Documentary script examples</a></li><li><a href="#part5">Make your documentary script come true by using Filmora</a></li></ul><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-a-Documentary"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-a-Documentary" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What is a Documentary?"></a>Part 1. What is a Documentary?</h2><p>To write a good documentary script, you should first know what a documentary is. A documentary is a genre usually used for non-fiction or reality-based films. Such type of films includes researched based representation of a specific subject like interviews of peoples involved in it, official documents related to it, and many more. Sometimes they tell us facts about a particular topic that only very few of us know. They are also beneficial to raising social issues to the officials and making others aware of them. Now that you know what a documentary is let’s move forward to our next step, three popular types of documentary scripts.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Three-popular-types-of-a-documentary-script"><a href="#Part-2-Three-popular-types-of-a-documentary-script" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Three popular types of a documentary script"></a>Part 2. Three popular types of a documentary script</h2><h3 id="1-Literary-Style"><a href="#1-Literary-Style" class="headerlink" title="1. Literary Style"></a>1. Literary Style</h3><p>In this style, your only concerns are with the shooting ability of the text for which you should have camera sense, writing rhetorically (but not too much) with the text language literacy, and dividing the script into different paragraphs according to time space and scene. You don’t have to describe the technical requirements of shooting in it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uSfA74aeYeA?si=HdJSMdeS7HVtS6-j" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-Shot-Oriented"><a href="#2-Shot-Oriented" class="headerlink" title="2. Shot-Oriented"></a>2. Shot-Oriented</h3><p>In this one, you have to write a detailed description of the action and the images which will be there in your screenplay without considering the script’s literary merits and readability. Also, in this style, each scene is divided into paragraphs, and before starting each section, the writer should have mentioned the scene’s location, time, mirror, and number. In simple words, this script style provides more detailed and deep instructions about the film or a documentary screenplay.</p><h3 id="3-Shooting-Script"><a href="#3-Shooting-Script" class="headerlink" title="3. Shooting Script"></a>3. Shooting Script</h3><p>The director usually uses this style of scripting. After the director of the film or the documentary, the screenplay reads the literary script. He writes a subordinate storyline, including the picture image and the sound, which he is agreed to represent in his film or documentary screenplay.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Six-basic-theoretical-knowledge-about-documentary-script"><a href="#Part-3-Six-basic-theoretical-knowledge-about-documentary-script" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Six basic theoretical knowledge about documentary script"></a>Part 3. Six basic theoretical knowledge about documentary script</h2><h3 id="1-Ensure-the-authenticity-of-the-story"><a href="#1-Ensure-the-authenticity-of-the-story" class="headerlink" title="1. Ensure the authenticity of the story"></a>1. Ensure the authenticity of the story</h3><p>The first and most important step in writing a documentary screenplay is to make sure the material and information you use is accurate. Moreover, if your documentary script is based on a true story, you should first confirm the veracity of the tale before drafting the script. It elevates the level of your script’s content quality.</p><h3 id="2-Define-the-key-issues"><a href="#2-Define-the-key-issues" class="headerlink" title="2. Define the key issues"></a>2. Define the key issues</h3><p>Another thing that makes a documentary script best is that it should define the critical issues of the topic upon which it relies. For example, writing a documentary script on a social problem, you should also define its key points. Also, you can add interviews of the experts, or the people involved in some story. It makes your documentary script more effective and influential for the audience.</p><h3 id="3-Highlight-the-characteristics-of-the-scene"><a href="#3-Highlight-the-characteristics-of-the-scene" class="headerlink" title="3. Highlight the characteristics of the scene"></a>3. Highlight the characteristics of the scene</h3><p>Highlighting the characteristics of each scene of your script makes it much better and easy for others to understand. For example, if you have any fighting scene in your documentary film, you should have to define each thing that will be there and film it in your screenplay. Also, you can suggest or specify the location of each scene.</p><h3 id="4-Visual-Writing"><a href="#4-Visual-Writing" class="headerlink" title="4. Visual Writing"></a>4. Visual Writing</h3><p>Visual Writing means you should make it clear in your script which will be there in a specific scene. Moreover, it would be best if you also described your character’s situation. It is the most necessary thing in a documentary script, so you should never take it side.</p><h3 id="5-Guaranteed-documentary-viewing-Rhythm"><a href="#5-Guaranteed-documentary-viewing-Rhythm" class="headerlink" title="5. Guaranteed documentary viewing (Rhythm)"></a>5. Guaranteed documentary viewing (Rhythm)</h3><p>Another important thing you should take care of while writing a documentary script is that you should continue it in a rhythm, which means you have to pay good attention to the sequence of the events in your film. In other words, you should arrange your script’s scenes effectively and accurately, making them in a rhythm.</p><h3 id="6-Fully-researched"><a href="#6-Fully-researched" class="headerlink" title="6. Fully researched"></a>6. Fully researched</h3><p>Thoroughly researched data and information are the most necessary, especially when writing a script for a documentary screenplay. It would be best first to explore a particular topic on which you will write a documentary script and then start writing one. It makes your script the best and helps you write it because you will gain excellent knowledge of it by researching a particular topic. Also, it dramatically improves the quality of your script’s content. So you should never leave this step before writing a documentary script.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Documentary-script-examples"><a href="#Part-4-Documentary-script-examples" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. Documentary script examples"></a>Part 4. Documentary script examples</h2><p>As you can see in the following example of a documentary script of a screenplay named “Albert Einstein.” In the following script example, you can see that we have described the images on the left and the narrations on the right side of the table. Also, the primary sources have been highlighted in it and are in bold text, which will help others to recognize them.</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>IMAGES</strong></th><th><strong>NARRATION</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Portrait of Albert Einstein</td><td>Once Albert Einstein said, “We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them.”</td></tr><tr><td>Pictures of Albert Einstein Theories</td><td>Have you guys ever wondered why Albert Einstein is the most genius person in history?</td></tr><tr><td>Picture of Albert Einstein’s Brain and then Common Human Brain</td><td>Why is he the only human to use his brain the most?</td></tr><tr><td>Some video shorts of Albert Einstein’s interviews</td><td>Why does he often forget his name even though he is too intelligent?</td></tr><tr><td>Pictures of Albert Einstein</td><td>The answer to this question is in his quote, “The true sign of intelligence is not knowledge but imagination.”</td></tr><tr><td>Pictures of Albert Einstein Theories</td><td>Also, do you guys know what Albert Einstein said about his intelligence?</td></tr><tr><td>Some video shorts of Albert Einstein’s interviews</td><td>He once said, “I have no special talent.”</td></tr><tr><td>Pictures of Albert Einstein and then his brain</td><td>However, he declined that he is brilliant.</td></tr><tr><td>Pictures of Albert Einstein Theories</td><td>But still, he is the one due to his various authentic and scientifically proven theories and experiments.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="Part-5-Make-your-documentary-script-come-true-by-using-Filmora"><a href="#Part-5-Make-your-documentary-script-come-true-by-using-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 5. Make your documentary script come true by using Filmora"></a>Part 5.

Ensure the authenticity of the story</h3><p>The first and most important step in writing a documentary screenplay is to make sure the material and information you use is accurate.

It elevates the level of your script’s content quality.</p><h3 id="2-Define-the-key-issues-1"><a href="#2-Define-the-key-issues-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Define the key issues"></a>2. Define the key issues</h3><p>Another thing that makes a documentary script best is that it should define the critical issues of the topic upon which it relies. For example, writing a documentary script on a social problem, you should also define its key points. Also, you can add interviews of the experts, or the people involved in some story. It makes your documentary script more effective and influential for the audience.</p><h3 id="3-Highlight-the-characteristics-of-the-scene-1"><a href="#3-Highlight-the-characteristics-of-the-scene-1" class="headerlink" title="3.

For example, if you have any fighting scene in your documentary film, you should have to define each thing that will be there and film it in your screenplay. Also, you can suggest or specify the location of each scene.</p><h3 id="4-Visual-Writing-1"><a href="#4-Visual-Writing-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Visual Writing"></a>4.

Contemporary Features</h3><p>Scenarios have had a similar structure since the beginning of the last century.</p><p>The same title page, with the same standard Courier font, text indentation, scene title&#x2F;slug line and subtitle prefixes (INT-EXT), action line layout, etc. All this has remained unchanged over the years.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/what-is-screenplay-4.jpg"                      alt="contemporary features"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zAzTErKy6h8?si=vi5z3M9_7fW6qiAJ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>However, with the advent of app-based screenwriting software, we have plenty of contemporary features such as automatic page numbers, time of day, parentheses, and pop-ups with specific character names.</p><p>Even the general rule of thumb “one-page equals one minute of screen time” doesn’t apply to all scripts today.</p><p>While it’s not necessary to have a fully automated script layout interface, any task that can be automated gives the writer more time for important tasks like contributing to off-screen production, recording voice-overs, etc.</p><p>Plus, since most writers today prefer a smartphone to a traditional typewriter, it pays to have a screenplay editor in the palm of your hand.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LT4sdZgUvRQ?si=SvQD5FouEzu4UHpJ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-Configurability"><a href="#4-Configurability" class="headerlink" title="4.

Configurability</h3><p>Rigid script formatting risks making your story look and sound like all the stories that have used it in the past.</p><p>The same events, the same character archetypes, the same moves and submissions, and the same build-ups can quickly become boring.</p><p>The best storyboard templates have a structure that is created with the genre of the story in mind but gives the writer room to play around with their characters, setting, etc.</p><p>For example, when I’m writing a character who’s learning to write a book, I’d like to show her picking up references from nature and various other creative genres and coming back to change her style—not just research from the works of other writers.</p><p>Taking an unconventional approach to character development can seem counterproductive and time-consuming. However, a good script draft will allow the writer to do this without making the script unbalanced.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qfCSLAhd4FY?si=CUBztmilaeAwl1lw" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="5-Creative-Space"><a href="#5-Creative-Space" class="headerlink" title="5.

Creative Space</h3><p>Stiffness is a very common factor in most traditional screenplay formats.</p><p>A certain rigidity is good because it keeps the story structured and prevents writers from focusing too deeply on one aspect and neglecting the rest.</p><p>However, script templates should not be too restrictive in terms of creative freedom for the writer.</p><p>For example, an ideal screenwriting template should allow one character out of several to experience a different phase of character development than the others at any point in the plot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/what-is-screenplay-5.jpg"                      alt="creative space"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o-sRtqHdEYY?si=NMTMQVxJsUaoguqh" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>This prevents all characters from looking and sounding like they were cast from a similar mold and have no unique development of their own.</p><p>In addition, the best templates should allow screenwriters to adjust their plot development to write for feature films as well as series.</p><p>Common fictional tropes have already been adopted by thousands of screenwriters around the world.

Thus, for most users, learning <strong>how to change slow-motion video to normal-speed Android</strong> is important.</p><p>In general, there is no built-in feature that allows Android users to change recorded video speed, like reversing slow motion. So, it would be best if you considered third-party tools in this case. Multiple options are usable in this context, and we explain some of the best ones here. Interested?

Up until only very recently, virtual reality was the exclusive domain of some select university researchers.</p><p> But now with the appearance of commercially available virtual reality software and peripherals, companies are capable and have now started building different virtual reality applications to solve some real engineering problems.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Virtual-Reality-in-Car-Manufacturing"><a href="#Virtual-Reality-in-Car-Manufacturing" class="headerlink" title="Virtual Reality in Car Manufacturing"></a>Virtual Reality in Car Manufacturing</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vr-in-car.jpg"                      alt="vr-in-car"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8dH3yHH9IX8?si=geiW5KbIljSFT9pz" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> The auto industry presently at the cusp of its latest transformation, being a leader in the adoption of virtual reality engineering in every process of the manufacturing, marketing, and sales, right from the design of new products to the industry’s marketing.</p><p> With the VR technology, however, the automotive manufacturers can speed up the development of new models from the concept phase to the final design more efficiently than ever before. It is said that Audi, Ford, Ferrari, Toyota, and Volvo are jumping on the VR bandwagon. Moreover, the vehicle shoppers can use VR to virtually test drive different vehicle models in the auto dealerships or at their own home.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e4Nt2xXXtmE?si=CtKwFry4b0AJXnaN" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Virtual-Reality-in-Aircraft"><a href="#Virtual-Reality-in-Aircraft" class="headerlink" title="Virtual Reality in Aircraft"></a>Virtual Reality in Aircraft</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vr-in-aircraft-manufacturing.jpg"                      alt="vr-in-aircraft-manufacturing"                ></p><p> In addition to training, which has been one of the pioneering uses of virtual reality in aviation by way of simulators, aviation can also make use of virtual reality for other important functions like marketing and for creating a superior in-flight experience for the fliers. For in-flight entertainment, a combination of VR-headset and earbuds can transform any of the newer models of a smartphone into a wireless private theatre or a virtual reality experience. Pilot performance is evaluated in a flight simulator instead of an actual aircraft, which is also true for pilots who are changing the types of aircrafts they fly. This helps save lots of money.</p><p> Operating a real aircraft for even an hour will be significantly more expensive than operating on the simulator of a similar plane. Besides, this allows the fleet to continue with its routine operations as no aircrafts are used for training purposes. Moreover, there is the very important aspect of safety. Virtual reality training on simulators allows the pilots to do and train for a lot of very critical things in the simulator. It enables them to be prepared for unforeseen situations like smoke in the cabin, engine failures, wheels up landing, ditching, etc. It might be almost impossible to train for these sort of stuff in a real aircraft. Virtual reality is also used by almost all aircraft manufacturers. They prepare a simulation that will replicate the experience they expect in their freshly designed aircrafts and have the test pilots in it and test it for various real life situations in an airplane. This allows the pilots to look out for some of the design flaws and ask for correction even before the first flight. What’s more, the pilots can practice in the simulated environment before actually flying, cutting down the costs significantly.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n-66V-LRK3Y?si=fNeB2pXCePeQli6E" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Virtual-Reality-in-Construction"><a href="#Virtual-Reality-in-Construction" class="headerlink" title="Virtual Reality in Construction"></a>Virtual Reality in Construction</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vr-in-construction.jpg"                      alt="vr-in-construction"                ></p><p> Of the many new technologies that are expected to impact the building sector in the near future, virtual reality engineering as a concept is one of the most important areas which may likely have a significant effect over the near term. Across all the sectors, the volume of investment that is being absorbed by this technology is huge. The construction business is not really going to miss out on this.</p><p> A recent survey conducted among the various leaders in this field, viz. the architecture, construction, virtual reality engineering by ARC Document Solutions Inc., a leading document and information management services provider for the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry, found that 65.3 per cent of the respondents thought that virtual reality would be used much more going forward in design and construction practice. Survey participants indicated that the virtual reality technologies make the projects very easy to visualize.</p><h2 id="Virtual-Reality-in-Appliance-Manufacturers"><a href="#Virtual-Reality-in-Appliance-Manufacturers" class="headerlink" title="Virtual Reality in Appliance Manufacturers"></a>Virtual Reality in Appliance Manufacturers</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vr-in-appliance-manufacturers.jpg"                      alt="vr-in-appliance-manufacturers"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S3Th6oa_isA?si=TTQ013BB9beUM4x6" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Virtual Reality can be very effective when planning on the electrical appliances. With the increased use of virtual reality engineering an appliance manufacturer can check for the exact storage capacity of an appliance like a refrigerator. The appliance manufacturers can also show demonstrations of appliances and get a better marketing feedback with the use of virtual reality products. The use of virtual reality helps eliminate design flaws in the original product. It also helps iron out some problems from the appliances and helps save significant costs with switching off the lights and fans. It also helps save them at their home to apply the finishing touch.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KaqfZcWg5sE?si=LPmSKk7AFp8VxDFD" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>The use of virtual reality engineering in different businesses can significantly help save the costs and add to the safety levels of product testing, etc. Virtual Reality Engineering has a very good future if it builds on its core competencies and helps present to the users of the final product a good experience even before the booking.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Benjamin Arango</p><p>Benjamin Arango is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Benjamin Arango</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/new-gaining-insights-how-to-ask-the-right-questions-for-2024/"><u>[New] Gaining Insights How to Ask the Right Questions for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-edge-of-entertainment-advanced-tiktok-editing-hacks/"><u>[New] In 2024, Edge of Entertainment Advanced TikTok Editing Hacks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-elevate-user-experience-with-these-leading-videophones/"><u>[New] In 2024, Elevate User Experience with These Leading Videophones</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-selecting-the-ultimate-business-vault/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Selecting the Ultimate Business Vault</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-startup-strategies-for-making-money-on-periscope/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Startup Strategies for Making Money on Periscope</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-voice-driven-operation-platform-zero-price/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Voice-Driven Operation Platform Zero Price</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-exploring-innovative-metaverse-memes-a-beginners-roadmap/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Exploring Innovative Metaverse Memes A Beginner's Roadmap</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-instagram-de-following-immediate-awareness/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Instagram De-Following Immediate Awareness</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/updated-photo-prospectus-top-10-professional-lens-choices/"><u>[Updated] Photo Prospectus Top 10 Professional Lens Choices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/updated-tunetracker-outside-of-dacast-realm-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] TuneTracker Outside of DaCast Realm for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://hardware-help.techidaily.com/find-top-savings-on-walmart-best-buy-ahead-of-prime-day-202n-exclusive-deals-revealed-by-zdnet/"><u>Find Top Savings on Walmart, Best Buy Ahead of Prime Day 202N: Exclusive Deals Revealed by ZDNet</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/in-2024-full-assessment-of-slomo-application-trends/"><u>In 2024, Full Assessment of SloMo Application - Trends</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/in-2024-instagram-shout-out-for-podcast-fans/"><u>In 2024, Instagram Shout-Out for Podcast Fans</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/leading-enterprise-cloud-vault-optimal-data-management/"><u>Leading Enterprise Cloud Vault Optimal Data Management</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-answers.techidaily.com/nba-2k21-pc-crashes-heres-how-you-can-solve-the-problem/"><u>NBA 2K21 PC Crashes?

Today, you can use  VP9, AV1 and other codecs on platforms like YouTube, Netflix, Facebook, Vimeo, and more. However, video codecs differ regarding file size, licensing, quality, and more. Now this brings us to the exciting <strong>AV1 vs VP9</strong> comparison. These two are currently some of the most widely used video codecs, especially on YouTube. So, which one should you use? Should you stick to the trusted VP9 or the brand-new AV1? This article helps you make the critical choice.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oeSN3u4fO9M?si=Ua3Hzcil6u6akDgY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-VP9"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-VP9" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What is VP9?"></a>Part 1. What is VP9?</h2><p>Released in 2013 by Google, VP9 is a free, open-source video codec that replaced VP8. This compression algorithm was released to compete with  a licensed video codec. VP9 enjoys broad support among modern HTML5 web browsers. In fact, VP9 has been compatible with Android since version 4.4 KitKat. This codec is also compatible with iOS&#x2F;iPadOS 14 or newer.</p><p>In the meantime, a 2014 comparison between VP9 and &#x2F;AVC discovered that VP9 offers a 45% bitrate advantage over. Netflix also concluded in 2016 that VP9  could have the same efficiency after tweaking the parameters. So overall, VP9 supports lossless encoding of raw bitstreams, making it perfect for streaming videos in MP4 and WebM.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-is-AV1"><a href="#Part-2-What-is-AV1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. What is AV1?"></a>Part 2. What is AV1?</h2><p>AV1 is a relatively new video codec by Alliance for Open Media, a consortium of which Google is a co-founder. Like VP9, it’s a royalty-free video codec, meaning you don’t have to pay licensing fee to use it. AV1 was developed to replace VP9, so expect it to be compatible with all VP9-supported platforms. Besides Google, the Alliance for Open Media also includes Netflix, Amazon, Cisco, Intel, Microsoft, and Mozilla.</p><p>The first AV1 version was released in 2016 but was held back due to unresolved critical bugs. Then in March 2018, the Alliance announced another release alongside software encoder&#x2F;decoder. Although the codec is primarily designed to compete with licensed codecs like  AVC, there are concerns that it may threaten the existence of other royalty-free codecs. But as a consumer, freebies are always a welcome addition.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Detailed-Comparison-Between-VP9-and-AV1"><a href="#Part-3-Detailed-Comparison-Between-VP9-and-AV1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Detailed Comparison Between VP9 and AV1"></a>Part 3. Detailed Comparison Between VP9 and AV1</h2><p>For viewers to enjoy high-quality content without using a lot of resources, efficient video compression technology is a must. As it stands, both VP9 and AV1 are royalty-free codecs, meaning that they are 100% free to use. However, these codecs differ. Here is what we’ve gathered for the <strong>VP9 vs AV1</strong> comparison:</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LBCobAYzzcc?si=J3eSTQ3AdyxWAjGo" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Compatibility-VP9-has-an-edge"><a href="#Compatibility-VP9-has-an-edge" class="headerlink" title="Compatibility - VP9 has an edge"></a>Compatibility - VP9 has an edge</h3><p>Both video compression techniques are relatively new, which AV1 being the latest. This means VP9 and AV1 are compatible with various HTML5 browsers and devices. Google says VP9 decoding is compatible with more than 2 billion endpoints, meaning you can open VP9 on Mozilla Firefox, Opera, Chrome, Safari, Edge, Android smartphones&#x2F;TVs, and local media players.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/av1-vs-vp9-1.jpg"                      alt="compatibility"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kiW7sLvL65k?si=IHSeRFsYCrfqpn2o" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>But on the other hand, viewers might experience an “error” message when opening AV1 locally on your old PC. While Intel works around the clock to develop supported drivers, some may not be compatible with your old computer. But expect wider AV1 compatibility now that more tech companies like Meta, Samsung, and Apple have joined the Alliance for Open Media. Currently, YouTube and Netflix are already streaming some videos in AV1.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d-COuhPT5mk?si=wLZU6jkkAdJuAn6h" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Performance-AV1-has-an-edge"><a href="#Performance-AV1-has-an-edge" class="headerlink" title="Performance - AV1 has an edge"></a>Performance - AV1 has an edge</h3><p>Regarding practical performance, it’s widely agreed that AV1 has the upper hand over standard codecs like VP9, and VP8. According to a test by EpsosVox on Intel’s AV1 encoder, the codec showed higher performance efficiency than NVIDIA’s NVENC, OBS x264, and AMF by AMD. The test results showed that the AV1 encoder is 16% better than the competing encoders.</p><p>Another 2018 Facebook Engineering (now Meta) test showed that AV1 achieved 34% higher compression than VP9. The test also showed that AV1 is 50.3% and 46.2% better than the x264 main profile and x264 high profile. However, the test showed that AV1 requires a longer encoding duration than the current alternative due to the complexities involved.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/av1-vs-vp9-2.jpg"                      alt="facebook av1 vs vp9 comparison"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_7AYCS7zBU0?si=7R9oIpE4hyEbtk3x" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Most importantly, Facebook suggested that AV1’s performance significantly increases with increased video resolution. This means viewers will enjoy a higher quality 8K and UHD&#x2F;4K content when using AV1 than VP9 and other codecs. And yes, higher compressions by AV1 mean a smaller file size at the same bitrates as the VP9 codec.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oySc0DiqmKc?si=8pynRzuhlq2RUPZ6" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Into-the-Future-AV1-is-the-Trend"><a href="#Into-the-Future-AV1-is-the-Trend" class="headerlink" title="Into the Future - AV1 is the Trend"></a>Into the Future - AV1 is the Trend</h3><p>You probably know that AV1 comes from VP9 and is having difficulties in widespread use due to longer decoding times. But things are different now.</p><p>In the year of 2022, AV1 hardware encoder made amazing progress in supports from graphics card manufacturers—August, Intel’s new Arc Alchemist GPUs integrates with AV1 encoding and the Intel Arc AV1 Encoder Easily Beats AMD and Nvidia.</p><p>YouTube Video: <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LznXh5lkgB0" >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LznXh5lkgB0 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Soon in the September, NVIDIA unveiled the GeForce RTX® 40 Series of GPUs, which comes with Dual NVIDIA Encoders (NVENC) that is able to “cut export times by up to half and feature AV1 support”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/av1-vs-vp9-3.jpg"                      alt="cut export times"                ></p><p>Let alone AV2 is upcoming in 3-5 years.

Which Editor Can Export an AV1 MP4 Video?"></a>Part 4. Which Editor Can Export an AV1 MP4 Video?</h2><p>If you’re a YouTuber, it’s evident that AV1 is the best codec to use. This codec delivers faster upload and download speeds, thanks to the higher compression levels over VP9. And as said before, AV1 offers better video quality than VP9 and other codecs, something that will get viewers trooping to your channel.</p><p>For these reasons, use <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora 11 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to create MP4 AV1 videos on your macOS&#x2F;Windows computer.
