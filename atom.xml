Besides a rich brush library, the app also gives you access to more than fifty settings for each brush and it lets you create your own brushes. It also supports third-party styluses which makes drawing or painting feel more natural.</p><p>The app is equipped with 3D Touch technology designed for pressure-sensitive painting, while its Silica M painting engine eliminates lagging. Procreate Pocket has an advanced layer system that includes clipping and layer masks that enable non-destructive editing. In addition, you can create vector text or use Isometric, Symmetry, 2D, and Perspective visual guidelines. However, the app is optimized for iPhone X and it may not work as smoothly on other versions of the iPhone.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139116/17108" target="_top" id="2139116">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139116" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139116/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="6-iColorama-S-–-Photo-Editor-and-Brush-Painter"><a href="#6-iColorama-S-–-Photo-Editor-and-Brush-Painter" class="headerlink" title="6. iColorama S – Photo Editor and Brush Painter"></a>6. <a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/icolorama-s/id518522388" >iColorama S – Photo Editor and Brush Painter <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><strong>Price:</strong> $4.99</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/icolorama-s-photo-editor-brush-painter.jpg"                      alt="iColorama S photo editor"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983475">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983475.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983475">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983475.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983475%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983475/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Although iColorama S is primarily a photo editing app, you can still use it to create digital paintings and drawings.

Use <strong>Microsoft speech to text</strong> service. This service was launched in 2020 alongside the text-to-speech service, which includes famous computer-generated voices like <strong>Microsoft Sam</strong> and his brother, Mike. So, in this short read, you’ll learn what <strong>Microsoft Azure speech to text</strong> service is and its capabilities. I’ll also introduce you to the best Microsoft Azure STT alternatives. Let’s hunker down!</p><p><strong>Top Alternative to Microsoft Azure STT</strong> Save plenty of time on transcribing subtitles and boost your editing efficiency by applying Filmora Speech-To-Text.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try STT Now <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try STT Now <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Explore STT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/banner/filmora-latest-product-box.png"                      alt="Wondershare Filmora"                ></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Microsoft-Azure-and-Speech-Studio"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Microsoft-Azure-and-Speech-Studio" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Microsoft Azure and Speech Studio?"></a>Part 1: What is Microsoft Azure and Speech Studio?</h2><p>Microsoft Azure STT and TTS are part of <strong>Microsoft Cognitive Services Speech</strong>. These cognitive services feature state-of-the-art intelligence covering voice recognition, speaker recognition, machine translation, and OCR (Optical Character Recognition). The Microsoft speech to text service uses Azure Machine Learning (Azure ML) to auto-recognize, analyze, and convert human voices to editable and searchable texts.</p><p>Having said that, Azure STT lets you transcribe streaming audio, microphone commentary, or local audio files. It supports 100+ languages, including English, German, French, Swahili, Hindi, Ukrainian, Turkish, Arabic, and more. Remember that this service also supports batch transcription, allowing you to transcribe multiple audios in batch.</p><p>In the meantime, Azure STT is available in many formats, including Speech SDK. Speech SDK (Software Development Kit) allows you to use popular programming languages to create a speech-enabled application. It’s compatible with Java, JavaScript, Python, Visual Studio C++, Swift, and Objective-C.</p><p>If you’re not good with programming languages, use Speech CLI, a command tool that allows you to use the speech recognition service without entering a code. Put simply, it features a minimal setup with precise requirements. Plus, it features pretty much everything you’ll find in Speech SDK. So, it depends on your skills and preference.</p><p>It is also worth noting that Azure Speech Studio supports keyword recognition or keyword spotting. You can generate keyword recognition models and specify any short phrase or word. Users can also personalize keywords with the correct punctuations. And best of all, there is no extra cost for customizing keywords.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Transcribe-Speech-to-Text-with-Microsoft-Speech-Studio"><a href="#Part-2-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Transcribe-Speech-to-Text-with-Microsoft-Speech-Studio" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Step by Step Guide to Transcribe Speech to Text with Microsoft Speech Studio"></a>Part 2: Step by Step Guide to Transcribe Speech to Text with Microsoft Speech Studio</h2><p>Now let’s learn how to use Microsoft Azure speech recognition services. Remember, the conversion may not be accurate if the audio has lots of domain-industry jargon or ambient noises. Therefore, use crisp-clear audio with an external mic or train the software to recognize specific words or keywords. Let’s get started!</p><p>Step1Start by creating a Microsoft Azure account. You’ll start with the free version, which gives you a <strong>$200 credit to use within 30 days</strong>. After depleting the free credits, use the pay-as-you-go model, which unlocks 40+ Azure services.</p><p>Step2After creating a Microsoft Azure portal, you’ll see all Azure services. Click the Speech Services tab or search for “speech services” on the search bar. Now click Create and then fill out the project details. Then, click Review and Create before clicking Create.</p><p>Step3The program will take a while to deploy an instance. Now tap Keys and endpoints on the left pane and copy the key and region identifier as you may need them later on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/microsoft-speech-to-text-1.jpg"                      alt="micrsoft azure speech to text copy key and region"                ></p><p>Step4Download and install Microsoft Visual C++ and .NET Core 3.1 Runtime. Next, install Speech CL on .NET by running this command “**dotnet tool install -global Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech.CLI.**” Alternatively, download and install Speech CLI for Windows PCs as a <a class="link"   href="https://aka.ms/speech/spx-windows" >ZIP file <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Step5Now enter the Azure regional identifier and subscription key on Windows Terminal or PowerShell. To configure the region and key, run these commands; “<strong>spx config @key –set SUBSCRIPTION-KEY</strong> and **spx config @region –set REGION.**”</p><p>Step6Now it’s time to convert speech to text using Azure STT Service. To do that, run “<strong>spx recognize -microphone</strong>” on Terminal or PowerShell. Azure Speech CLI will listen to sound input and convert it to text.

You need some knowledge of programming and Windows Command Prompt. Even worse, you’ll have to pay each time you want to convert speech to text after depleting the free credits.</p><p>Fortunately, there’s no shortage of free speech to text converters for beginners. So, in this part, we’ll discuss some free Microsoft Azure STT alternatives for beginners.</p><h3 id="1-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#1-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="1.

It’s a video editor for creating award-winning videos without prior editing skills. Just upload your local video and edit it as you please. And yes, it works with a host of video formats.</p><p>When you want to make perfect videos, you can use Filmora’s STT feature. Wondershare Filmora Speech to Text is quite different with other STT service providers. Other STT platforms&#x2F;stages require you to use the application to convert speech-to-text, save, and export into other third-party software. However, Wondershare Filmora allows you to directly convert your speech-to-text on an ongoing production. For example, you can convert speech into subtitles during a video production on Wondershare Filmora.</p><p>What’s more, now Filmora’s STT feature supports direct transcription of bilingual subtitles with up to 27 languages of transcription in Filmora.</p><h3 id="Top-Adavantages-of-Filmora-STT"><a href="#Top-Adavantages-of-Filmora-STT" class="headerlink" title="Top Adavantages of Filmora STT"></a>Top Adavantages of Filmora STT</h3><ul><li>Supports direct transcription of bilingual subtitles.</li><li>Allows to transcribe video speech to text in one click.</li><li>Boosts editing efficiency by applying the STT feature.</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Make STT Videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Make STT Videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><h3 id="Use-Filmora-To-Make-STT-videos"><a href="#Use-Filmora-To-Make-STT-videos" class="headerlink" title="Use Filmora To Make STT videos"></a>Use Filmora To Make STT videos</h3><h5 id="Step-1"><a href="#Step-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 1"></a>Step 1</h5><p>Select the audio asset in the timeline, and click the “Speech-to-Text” icon in the toolbar; if there is no supported file type on the timeline, it will not be displayed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/guide-win/toolbar-stt.jpg"                      alt="toolbar stt"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135406/19272" target="_top" id="2135406">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135406" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135406/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h5 id="Step-2"><a href="#Step-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 2"></a>Step 2</h5><p>Click the “Speech-to-Text” icon, and it will show the parameter settings.

As expected, this voice transcription tool recognizes hundreds of languages, like English, French, Italian, Hindi, etc.</p><p>But although it does a commendable job, less-than-clear audio won’t give you accurate transcriptions. Also, it doesn’t feature niceties like periods, commas, and other punctuations. As such, stick to a professional app like Filmora to transcribe your audio to text.</p><p>Steps to convert voice to text with Google Docs:</p><p>Step1Open a new document on Google Docs and then click Voice typing. The inbuilt microphone will automatically launch.</p><p>Step2Next, click the language drop-down arrow on the microphone to choose the transcription language. You can dictate texts in English, Espanol, French, Italian, Afrikaans, Arabic, and more.</p><p>Step3Click the Microphone icon to start dictating texts on Google Docs.

The iPhone can be an excellent tool for anyone wishing to produce outstanding music videos on a limited budget thanks to the device’s powerful camera features. To get the best results possible, it’s wise to use a tripod, find out more about how your iPhone works, enlist the services of a director and use professional editing software.

To achieve the required level of stability, it’s a great idea to use a tripod. A tripod will help you produce a high-quality music video with a stable picture. Make sure you use a compact tripod that is easy to carry and operate to get the best results.</p><p> A tripod will help you if you are shooting static footage, but if you wish to move around whilst you are recording and still obtain outstanding footage you can use a gimbal. Gimbals are much more affordable than they once were and are ideal for vloggers in particular as well as those shooting action-fuelled scenes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/jellyfish-metal-spring-tripod.jpg"                      alt="tripod"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://dhgate.sjv.io/c/5597632/1175223/12108" target="_top" id="1175223">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/12108-1175223" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://dhgate.sjv.io/i/5597632/1175223/12108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Know-the-technical-details-of-your-iPhone"><a href="#Part-2-Know-the-technical-details-of-your-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Know the technical details of your iPhone"></a>Part 2: Know the technical details of your iPhone</h2><p> You can record HD video with your rear-facing camera once you have read up on how to do so. The iPhone allows you to shoot 4K video, and you can even determine the number of frames per second you want to capture, in order to create smooth, hi-resolution footage. As long as you have the iPhone 6 or above and it is running on at least iOS 9, you’ll be able to capture 4K footage.</p><p> To enable 4K shooting, you must head to your settings and request it. You can do this by clicking through to Settings &gt; Camera and tapping either Record Video or Record Slow-mo. You can then select the required resolution from the options on your screen. You do need to remember that higher resolutions take up more space on your device. For instance, 4K video at frames per second will require 400MB of space per minute, which is ten times more than 720 HD at 30fps. However, by creating the necessary space, you can obtain outstandingly crisp footage for your music video. You can reduce the level of space needed by choosing 4K at 24fps (135MB per minute) or at 30fps (170MB).</p><p> If you wish to opt for slo-mo video recording, you can shoot in 1080p HD at 120fps (170MB per min) or 240fps (480MB). Whichever option you choose, make sure your device has sufficient space to avoid missing out on the exceptional footage that you require.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Shooting-iPhone.jpg"                      alt="iphone technical details"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2111967/7443" target="_top" id="2111967">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2111967" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2111967/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="2127886">                    <video width="576" height="1024" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/2127886.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2127886">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/2127886.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Funicoeye.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F2127886%2F18498'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2127886/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-If-possible-hire-a-video-director"><a href="#Part-3-If-possible-hire-a-video-director" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: If possible, hire a video director"></a>Part 3: If possible, hire a video director</h2><p> No matter how confident you are working without a director, you can enhance the quality of your music video even further when you do hire one.

Editing software solutions like Filmore offer a range of features to boost the quality of your video including inbuilt audio synthesisers and special video effects, enabling you to match your music with your images perfectly. There are many exceptional music video editing software packages on the market that are simple to use and easy to get to grips with, even if you have little or no existing editing experience.

Since that time slow-motion cameras have become much more affordable which enabled a myriad of video content creators to capture fascinating videos in slow-motion. Building suspense, making a scene more dramatic, or capturing movement that is too rapid to be observed with a naked eye is only a few reasons why filmmakers choose to record their footage in slow-motion. Read on, if you are looking for a camera that can help you capture mind-boggling slow-motion videos because in this article we are going to take you through the best slow-motion cameras in 2024 that fit both moderate and big budgets.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Best-Slow-Motion-Cameras-in-2024-1"><a href="#Best-Slow-Motion-Cameras-in-2024-1" class="headerlink" title="Best Slow Motion Cameras in 2024"></a>Best Slow Motion Cameras in 2024</h2><p>You no longer need a professional camera to record videos at high frame rates, in fact, some recent Smartphone models allow you to shoot videos at both high resolutions and high frame rates, which makes them perfect for the production of slow-motion videos. Let’s take a look at some of the best slow-motion cameras you can find on the market in 2024.</p><h4 id="1-Huawei-P30-Pro"><a href="#1-Huawei-P30-Pro" class="headerlink" title="1. Huawei P30 Pro"></a>1. <a class="link"   href="https://consumer.huawei.com/en/phones/p30-pro/" >Huawei P30 Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> $899.00</p><p>Only a few months after its release, Huawei P30 Pro is already setting the standards of Smartphone photography and videography, much like its predecessor Huawei P20 Pro has done a year earlier. The phone is equipped with a Leica Quad Rear Camera with 40MP, 20MP, 8MP, and TOF sensors, while it also features a 32MP front camera. The Huawei P30 Pro is capable of capturing slow-motion videos at 120fps, 240fps, and whooping 960fps, but it is only possible to record slow-motion videos in 1080p resolution at 120fps. The maximum resolution for super slow-motion videos captured at 240fps or 960fps is limited to 720p.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>6,47-inch FHD OLED screen</li><li>8GB RAM + 256GB ROM</li><li>40 MP (Wide Angle Lens, f&#x2F;1.6 aperture,OIS) + 20 MP (Ultra Wide Angle Lens, f&#x2F;2.2 aperture) + 8 MP (Telephoto, f&#x2F;3.4 aperture,OIS)</li><li>32 MP, f&#x2F;2.0 aperture front camera</li><li>4K and Full HD resolution recordings</li><li>ISO (50 to 409,600), shutter speed (1&#x2F;4000s to 30s)</li><li>Huawei AI Image Stabilization</li><li>Support for Phase and Contrast Autofocus</li></ul><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>Remarkable slow-motion video recording features</li><li>Excellent performance in low light conditions</li><li>High image quality</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>Incredibly light, which makes it ill-suited for handheld shots</li><li>Pricy</li><li>The quality of the videos recorded at 960fps is underwhelming</li></ul><h4 id="2-iPhone-XR"><a href="#2-iPhone-XR" class="headerlink" title="2. iPhone XR"></a>2. <a class="link"   href="https://www.apple.com/iphone-xr/" >iPhone XR <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price</strong>: $749</p><p>You can hardly go wrong if you choose iPhone XR to record slow-motion videos, take pictures or shoot 4K videos at 60, 30, or 24fps. Unfortunately, you can’t capture slow-motion footage in 4K resolution, but you can decide if you want your slow-motion video to be recorded in 1080p resolution at 240fps or 120fps. Additionally, you can shoot a slow-motion video in 720p resolution at 240fps. The iPhone XR features a 12MP wide-angle camera that is much less powerful than the cameras featured on Huawei P30 Pro. Nonetheless, this iPhone model is still one of the best options for videographers that want to shoot high-quality slow-motion videos.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>1-inch diagonal all-screen LCD Multi-Touch display with IPS technology</li><li>Water and dust resistant</li><li>4K video recording at 24fps,30fps, and 60fps</li><li>Slow-motion video recording at 1080p at 120fps and 240fps</li><li>Time-lapse video stabilization</li><li>7MP f&#x2F;2.2 aperture TrueDepth Camera</li><li>Continuous autofocus</li><li>Cinematic video stabilization</li></ul><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>Superb slow-motion video quality</li><li>Excellent dynamic range</li><li>Powerful camera sensor</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>Slow-motion video recording options are similar to those on earlier iPhone models</li><li>Slow-motion video files are large in size</li><li>Capturing slow-motion video in 4K resolution is not an option</li></ul><h4 id="3-GoPro-Hero-7-Black"><a href="#3-GoPro-Hero-7-Black" class="headerlink" title="3.

In addition, the number of features a camera offers besides the slow-motion video recording options are also something you should pay attention to because you must be able to use a video camera for more than just one purpose. Consequently, if you are looking for a camera that enables you to create slow-motion videos you can quickly share on social media, then Huawei P30 Pro or iPhone XR is your go-to option. Videographers who need a video camera they can use for professional assignments should invest in a powerful camcorder like Sony PXW-FS7.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Recording your outdoor adventures or capturing a perfect moment in slow-motion can be a great way to share your stories with your friends on social media. Furthermore, slow-motion is frequently used in TV commercials and full feature films so you have to pick a camera that is best suited for the type of slow-motion video you’re trying to make.

The key feature that makes it different from other messaging apps is that users can send text messages, pictures, and short videos that disappear after they are viewed.</p><p>Over the years, Snapchat has introduced various features that elevated its status from being an instant messaging app to a social media platform. In November 2020, Snapchat rolled out a new feature called Spotlight that has become a massive hit among users.</p><p>The Spotlight feature aims to make Snapchat compete with TikTok and Instagram Reels. As you may have guessed now, Spotlight is a collection of the most entertaining videos posted by app users.</p><p>Whether you want to post your videos on Snapchat Spotlight or want to know more about them, you just need to go through this article.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="What-Exactly-is-Snapchat-Spotlight"><a href="#What-Exactly-is-Snapchat-Spotlight" class="headerlink" title="What Exactly is Snapchat Spotlight?"></a>What Exactly is Snapchat Spotlight?</h2><p>Snapchat introduced Spotlight as a whole new section in its app that features several engaging short videos, also known as Snaps. The maximum duration of a video can be up to 1 minute or 60 seconds. Content creators must submit their videos to Spotlight so that moderators can review them and decide if they are worthy of featuring in the Spotlight section.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, the intention of adding the Spotlight feature in Snapchat is to engage users through short-form user videos, just like TikTok. After the massive popularity gained by TikTok in 2020, many platforms tried following the same path to glory, including Snapchat and Instagram.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2036481/19272" target="_top" id="2036481">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2036481" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2036481/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Snapchat-Spotlight-vs-TikTok-Main-Differences"><a href="#Snapchat-Spotlight-vs-TikTok-Main-Differences" class="headerlink" title="Snapchat Spotlight vs TikTok: Main Differences"></a>Snapchat Spotlight vs TikTok: Main Differences</h3><p>When comparing Snapchat and TikTok, there are specific differences that you can quickly notice. Let’s discuss those differences below:</p><p><strong>● Comments Sections</strong></p><p>While watching short-form videos on TikTok, you can leave your thoughts in the comments. However, you get no such comments section in the Snapchat Spotlight.</p><p><strong>● Privacy Protection</strong></p><p>If we talk about TikTok, you can view the display name of the content creator for each video. On the other hand, Snapchat enforces a strict privacy protection mechanism that hides the display name of creators if they are under 18. However, there’s an option to use a public profile if users below 18 wish to make their display name available to viewers.</p><h3 id="Guidelines-for-Submitting-Snapchat-Spotlight"><a href="#Guidelines-for-Submitting-Snapchat-Spotlight" class="headerlink" title="Guidelines for Submitting Snapchat Spotlight"></a>Guidelines for Submitting Snapchat Spotlight</h3><p>It’s easy to submit snaps (short-form videos) on Snapchat Spotlight. However, it is essential to ensure that your videos adhere to specific guidelines set by Snapchat. This section aims to make you familiar with them.</p><p><strong>Video Requirements</strong></p><p>The snaps that you want to submit to Spotlight should meet the following technical requirements:</p><ul><li>The minimum duration of a snap is 5 seconds, while the maximum is 60 seconds.</li><li>The video should be in portrait orientation.</li><li>The minimum aspect ratio of a snap is 3:4.</li><li>The horizontal resolution of a snap must be at least 640 px.</li><li>There shouldn’t be any logo in the snap.</li><li>The content of the snap should cover the complete frame.</li></ul><p>If your snap doesn’t meet the above-mentioned requirements, it will become ineligible for getting featured on Spotlight.</p><p><strong>Submission Terms</strong></p><p>There are certain community guidelines that apply to all Spotlight snaps. These guidelines ensure that the snaps within Spotlight entertain people without hurting their sentiments in any way.</p><p>While posting a snap on Spotlight, you need to avoid content that contains the following:</p><ul><li>Sexual acts</li><li>Harassment and bullying</li><li>Threats, violence, or harm</li><li>Illegal activities</li><li>Terrorism and hate speech</li></ul><p>You can go through the official <a class="link"   href="https://snap.com/en-US/community-guidelines" >Snapchat community guidelines <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to learn more.</p><h2 id="How-to-Use-Snapchat-Spotlight"><a href="#How-to-Use-Snapchat-Spotlight" class="headerlink" title="How to Use Snapchat Spotlight?"></a>How to Use Snapchat Spotlight?</h2><p>Snapchat Spotlight is relatively easy to use, especially if you are familiar with YouTube Shorts and TikTok. If you want to submit snaps to Spotlight, you will be happy to know that the whole process is quick and straightforward. The only thing that will consume a significant time is the snap creation itself.</p><p>If you already have a video or a snap idea that can make it to Spotlight, you need to know the steps for submitting a snap to Spotlight.

Then, here comes another important question: How to become a successful Snapchat creator?</p><p>Similar to TikTok and YouTube Shorts, there’s massive competition among creators on Snapchat. Both existing and new creators submit numerous snaps daily to get featured on Spotlight. So, how come you improve your chances of making it to Spotlight?</p><p>Well, the first thing you need to know is the algorithm that Snapchat Spotlight utilizes to show snaps to users. Secondly, there are some tips to help you build your Snapchat community. We’ll discuss both of them in the following sections.</p><h3 id="Snapchat-Spotlight-Algorithm-A-Brief-Overview"><a href="#Snapchat-Spotlight-Algorithm-A-Brief-Overview" class="headerlink" title="Snapchat Spotlight Algorithm: A Brief Overview"></a>Snapchat Spotlight Algorithm: A Brief Overview</h3><p>Snapchat makes use of a specialized algorithm for Spotlight. The algorithm decides what snaps to show to a particular user based on their interests and other factors.</p><p>The following are the key factors that the Spotlight algorithm considers for showing users the most relevant and exciting snaps.</p><p><strong>Unique Views</strong></p><p>A unique view means a user viewed a snap at least once in a single session. If a user views a snap multiple times in a single session, it will still be considered a unique view.</p><p><strong>Total View Time</strong></p><p>It represents the total time that users have spent watching a snap. If a user watches a single snap multiple times, the duration of each individual view will be added to the total view time.</p><p><strong>Number of Times the Video was Shared</strong></p><p>It represents the total number of times Snapchat users shared a particular snap with others.</p><p><strong>Number of Screenshots</strong></p><p>This factor considers the total number of times a screenshot was taken of a snap by a user.</p><h3 id="Quick-Tips-to-Build-Your-Snapchat-Community"><a href="#Quick-Tips-to-Build-Your-Snapchat-Community" class="headerlink" title="Quick Tips to Build Your Snapchat Community"></a>Quick Tips to Build Your Snapchat Community</h3><p>Your Snapchat community is your audience who loves to watch and interact with your snaps. Building a Snapchat community means growing your audience by delivering genuine, entertaining, and engaging content.</p><p>Here are some tips that can help you build a Snapchat community.</p><p><strong>Choose a Niche</strong></p><p>Uploading random snaps will not earn you a loyal audience on Spotlight. So, you need to pick a specific niche, such as gaming, pranks, and comedy, to target a particular audience with your snaps.</p><p><strong>Use Snapchat’s Built-in Creative Tools</strong></p><p>Snapchat provides several tools to help you become more creative with your snaps. Using those creative tools is good as the Spotlight algorithm pretends to prioritize videos edited with Snapchat’s native tools.</p><p><strong>Stay Consistent</strong></p><p>It is challenging to post snaps consistently, especially if you are just starting. However, maintaining consistency with your Snaps will help you earn more audience.</p><h2 id="A-Bonus-Tip-A-Great-Video-Editor-Facilitates-Your-Snapchat-Creating-Journey"><a href="#A-Bonus-Tip-A-Great-Video-Editor-Facilitates-Your-Snapchat-Creating-Journey" class="headerlink" title="A Bonus Tip: A Great Video Editor Facilitates Your Snapchat Creating Journey"></a>A Bonus Tip: A Great Video Editor Facilitates Your Snapchat Creating Journey</h2><p>Hopefully, you have known how to use Snapchat Spotlight and been ready to plan your creator life.

It’s really free to utilize one of the most well-liked ones. You want to make your voice better for your next audio production, right? You most likely searched the internet and came across some cool audio program named Audacity. Mix tracks or add effects to your recordings to edit your audio utilizing the cut, copy, and paste tools with limitless undo capability.</p><p>For audio analysis applications, Audacity additionally has an integrated amplitude-envelope editor, a customizable spectrogram mode, and a frequency-analysis window. The ideal way to get started in the realm of audio editing is using Audacity. It was created by volunteers using open-source software. With Audacity, you can do a lot of things, such trim files to make them shorter, take away background noise, cut out silence, change volume, and more. The drop-down menu located underneath the sound level meters on top allows you to rapidly choose between the numerous audio sources.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Crossfade"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Crossfade" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What is Crossfade?"></a>Part 1. What is Crossfade?</h2><p>Crossfading process allows two sounds to segue smoothly into one another. Crossfading is an audio effect that is often used in audio engineering to merge two or more sounds in a song gradually rather than suddenly. This method is mostly used to prevent any abrupt silences between two songs, which might disturb listeners. As a result of the development of the computer-based digital audio editor, crossfading became more straightforward.</p><p>When you cross fade music, you cause one piece of audio to fade out—the sound gradually vanishes—at the precise same moment as another piece of audio fades in—the sound gradually manifests. This effect produces a seamless transition between the two songs without any abrupt pauses or quiet in between. The volume of audio in the source files is the sole restriction on the duration of the fade in a digital editor that supports crossfading between two or more files.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Use-Crossfading-in-Audacity"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Use-Crossfading-in-Audacity" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How To Use Crossfading in Audacity"></a>Part 2. How To Use Crossfading in Audacity</h2><p>Don’t be intimidated by the capabilities of this audio program. Before the first event completely vanishes into the second, the crossfade gradually transitions by overlaying the events at the transition point so that both are seen or heard at the same time. Using Audacity, it’s easy to reduce some of the background noise in your audio track. You must create a noise profile to do this. We’ve put up a helpful guide on how to use Audacity to enhance your audio productions.</p><p><strong>Steps to Use Audacity Crossfade</strong>:</p><p>Step1 Select File, Import, and Audio from the menu. You may choose one or more audio files, and Audacity will automatically import them into the current project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/import-audio-into-audacity.jpg"                      alt="import audio into audacity"                ></p><p>Step2 Select File, followed by Recent files. The first of the 12 most recent saved or imported files will be imported if you do this.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/select-import-recent-files.jpg"                      alt="select import recent files"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2130871/7443" target="_top" id="2130871">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2130871" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2130871/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Step3 Use your Selection tool to align the clips so that a crossfade will be applied between two clips on different tracks. Go to Effect &gt; Crossfade Songs, place the cursor where you want the fade to begin, then drag it across the tracks you wish to blend.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/crossfade-songs-audacity.jpg"                      alt="crossfade songs audacity"                ></p><p>Step4 Using the Time Shift Tool, place your two clips adjacent to one another in order to apply a crossfade across them on the same track. Select the area to be crossfaded using the Selection tool, and then click Effect &gt; Crossfade Clips to combine the sounds you’ve chosen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/combine-sound-clips-audacity.jpg"                      alt="combine sound clips audacity"                ></p><p>Step5 This project should be exported as an MP3. Once you’ve finished editing, choose File &gt; Export &gt; Export as MP3 from the menu. From this point on, a pop-up window with a number of fields will appear, allowing you to choose how the file is saved.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1886015/19272" target="_top" id="1886015">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1886015" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1886015/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-Alternative-Way-to-Fade-Audio"><a href="#Part-3-Alternative-Way-to-Fade-Audio" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

Therefore, other apps should not be used during recording because they can use computer bandwidth and cause video quality to decline. In addition, most Mac users have complained that the Photo Booth application freezes and crashes while recording a video or that it has a freezing&#x2F;lagging issue.</p><p>The program frequently freezes, even shortly after you start recording, indicating that it is not a problem caused by the video’s duration or size. Press the stop button to see the notorious “spinning wheel of death” or a Beach Ball symbol when you finish recording. As many users have experienced, you may encounter the following issues with Photo Booth.</p><ul><li>While capturing videos, Photo Booth freezes every 30 seconds.</li><li>The video recording in the Photo Booth is sluggish.</li><li>After capturing a picture, the Photo Booth freezes, and no picture appears.</li><li>The video and audio in the Photo Booth recording are out of sync.</li></ul><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="How-to-fix-the-photo-booth-video-to-keep-freezing"><a href="#How-to-fix-the-photo-booth-video-to-keep-freezing" class="headerlink" title="How to fix the photo booth video to keep freezing?"></a>How to fix the photo booth video to keep freezing?</h2><p>Here are some ways you can try to fix the photo booth from freezing:</p><ul><li>If you’re recording while using many apps other than the Photo Booth software, your Mac’s processor may be nearing its maximum.

This tool is one of the most dependable, aside from the features that allow you to modify video rotation easily.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Import the video file</strong></p><p>To access the primary editing interface, open Wondershare Filmora and select “New Project.” Then select “Import” to load files from your computer. You can also connect your devices by dragging and dropping files into the software or using the Import option. Filmora can handle images, video, and audio files with ease.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/photo-booth-video-freezing-1.jpg"                      alt="photo-booth-video-freezing-"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068408/7443" target="_top" id="2068408">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068408" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068408/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>Step 2: Organize the media</strong></p><p>Filmora’s Media tab, underneath the Load button, will hold the files you import into the editor. However, when searching for the video clips, you want to add to the timeline, working with many different files in a single project becomes considerably more difficult. To reduce clutter and confusion, use the My Album feature, which allows you to create folders and organize your files.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/photo-booth-video-freezing-2.jpg"                      alt="photo-booth-video-freezing-"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144289/7443" target="_top" id="2144289">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144289" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144289/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>To create and name a new folder, click the Add a New Folder icon in the top right corner of the editor’s screen, situated at the bottom of the My Project page. You can sort the footage alphabetically or any other way that improves your efficiency and reduces the time you spend looking through files.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Add Effects</strong></p><p>You may now disconnect the audio and video files, add music, make transitions between the clips, or utilize one of Filmora’s many graphic effects after deleting all the undesirable sections from your video clips.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/photo-booth-video-freezing-3.jpg"                      alt="photo-booth-video-freezing-"                ></p><p>If you want to add opening titles, end credits, or subtitles to a video, click the Text &#x2F;Credit icon. The software comes with various text templates that you can use for various reasons. Drag and drop the template you chose to the proper spot on the timeline, then use the software’s preview box to add the required text.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/photo-booth-video-freezing-4.jpg"                      alt="photo-booth-video-freezing-"                ></p><p>Next to the Text&#x2F;Credit symbol, you’ll find the Transitions icon in the editor’s toolbar, which gives you access to hundreds of settings. Learn more about video transitions and how to apply them in Filmora by watching this video tutorial.</p><p><strong>Step 4: Export and Share</strong></p><p>When you’re certain there’s nothing else you want to change or add to your project, click the Export button. You can quickly select the video file format in the Format menu in the Output window and optimize the video for Smartphones, iPads, or gaming consoles like the PS4 or Xbox One.</p><p>Select the file type that best suits the project you’re working on from the Format tab, gives the video a title, and choose the folder on your hard drive where the video will be exported. Next, you can select the video resolution, modify the frame rate, and choose an encoder by clicking the Settings button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/photo-booth-video-freezing-5.jpg"                      alt="photo-booth-video-freezing-"                ></p><p>How to fix the photo booth video to keep freezing?</p><p>Here are some ways you can try to fix the photo booth from freezing:</p><ul><li>If you’re recording while using many apps other than the Photo Booth software, your Mac’s processor may be nearing its maximum.

The trouble is, that each scene you shoot is going to have different light values, which means that you’ll have to adjust the iPhone camera settings each time you decide to take a photo on a new location.</p><p><strong>How to Avoid Sources of Light in a Shot:</strong> The first and most basic rule of photography is to try to avoid having sources of light in your shot, and the best way to achieve this is to turn your back to the light source and have the subject of the photo positioned in the direction from which the light is coming from. If you do this, taking pictures that depict stark contrast of shadows and light will become much easier.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/take-use-shadows-in-photography.jpg"                      alt="take-use-shadows-in-photography"                ></p><p> Image resource: Contrastly</p><p><strong>How to Take a Silhouette Photo:</strong> If you want to take a silhouette photo, simply place the subject of a photo between the light source and your iPhone camera. The source of light in the background will direct too much light into your camera, which will force you to reduce the exposure of a photo, thus the subject of the photo will become underexposed or a mere silhouette.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/get-silhoutte-photo.jpg"                      alt="get-silhoutte-photo"                ></p><p> Image resource: YouTube</p><p><strong>How to Take Advantage of Natural Light:</strong> The best periods during the day for photography are the sunrise and the sunset because the light provided by the sun is the softest. Portrait and numerous other genres of photography benefit from soft, diffused light. The colors in your pictures will appear much warmer and the results you’ll be able to get will be much more visually pleasing than on photos on which you used direct lightning.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/golden-hour-photo.jpg"                      alt="golden-hour-photo"                ></p><p> Image resource: Contrastly</p><h4 id="2-Learn-How-To-Compose-Your-Photos-and-Videos"><a href="#2-Learn-How-To-Compose-Your-Photos-and-Videos" class="headerlink" title="2.  Learn How To Compose Your Photos and Videos"></a>2.  Learn How To Compose Your Photos and Videos</h4><p> Organization of the elements depicted within a frame is called composition, and each iPhone videographer or photographer has to practice shot composition in order to be able to improve the quality of the visual content they are producing. Some of the most basic principles of picture composition include the rule of thirds or the diagonal method of arranging objects on a photo.</p><p><strong>How to Use the Grid feature:</strong> The Grid feature on iPhone camera app can help you master the rule of thirds because it will divide your screen into nine equal rectangles, so you can use each rectangle to improve the organization of the elements within a shot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/grid-mode-iphone.jpg"                      alt="grid-mode-iphone"                ></p><p> Image resource: Macworld</p><p><strong>How to Use the Diagonal Method of Image Composition:</strong> Using the diagonal method of photo composition is also a fairly simple task, since you just need to follow a diagonal of the frame, and you can use this method on horizontally and vertically oriented images.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/diagonal-photography.jpg"                      alt="diagonal-photography"                ></p><p> Image resource: PictureCorrect</p><p><strong>How to Use Symetry on a Photo:</strong> Symmetry is often used for the depiction of reflections because this method of photo composition enables you to show the real object or a scene and its reflections in equal measure. Symmetric photos are more pleasing to the human eye than asymmetric images, which is the reason why pictures that use symmetry as the guiding compositional principal have a better chance of being recognized as good or beautiful.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/symetry-photography.jpg"                      alt="symetry-photography"                ></p><p> Image resource: PictureCorrect</p><h4 id="3-Use-Different-Camera-Angles-to-Depict-a-Scene"><a href="#3-Use-Different-Camera-Angles-to-Depict-a-Scene" class="headerlink" title="3.  Use Different Camera Angles to Depict a Scene"></a>3.  Use Different Camera Angles to Depict a Scene</h4><p><strong>How to Use 180-degree Rule:</strong> When approaching a new scene, even a simple scene such as a selfie, try to visualize a straight line at the height of your eye level between the iPhone camera you are holding and the subject of the photo. The so-called 180-degree rule suggests that you shouldn’t ever cross that imaginary line, but each degree between 0 and 180 degrees can be an angle from which you take the shot.</p><p><strong>How to Use Low-Angle Shots:</strong> Every camera position that goes above this line is called the bird’s eye view, and each camera position below this line is called a low-angle shot. Placing the camera below the level of your eyesight can be quite beneficial for the photo’s aesthetic qualities because it will offer a unique view of the scene to the viewer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/low-angle-shot-photography.jpg"                      alt="low-angle-shot-photography"                ></p><p> Image resource: Storyboard Class</p><p> Exploring different camera angles will enable you to show the scene from different points of view and it will allow you to ‘solve’ the scene in a more efficient way. Assuming that the best angle for a certain scene is at our eye level is natural, but trying to depict a scene from different points of view usually results in better pictures.</p><h4 id="4-Accentuate-Depth-in-Your-Images"><a href="#4-Accentuate-Depth-in-Your-Images" class="headerlink" title="4.  Accentuate Depth in Your Images"></a>4.  Accentuate Depth in Your Images</h4><p><strong>How to Separate the Foreground From the Background:</strong> The illusion of depth in a photo makes the picture look more realistic, and it also creates a visual dynamics between the foreground and the background of an image. There are a number of techniques you can use to accentuate depth on your photos or in your videos. The most common trick is to move the subject of your photo into the background and have the elements in the foreground lead the spectator to the subject.</p><p> <strong>How to Use Shallow Depth of Field:</strong> Alternatively, you can place the subject of a photo in the foreground, thus creating a considerable amount of separation between the two picture planes. The blurry background surrounding the razor-sharp foreground creates an illusion of depth that captivates the viewer’s attention. In order to achieve this you need to create a shallow depth of field, which may not be an easy task when using an iPhone camera, fortunately, there are a lot of apps at the App Store that can be used to highlight the illusion of depth in a photo.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/separate-the-foreground-from-background.jpg"                      alt="separate-the-foreground-from-background"                ></p><p> Image resource: Makeuseof</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AIMmjowaFs4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/Y5UmwDaI7HU/s250-c-k/photo.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Liza Brown</p><p>Liza Brown is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Liza Brown</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/new-highlight-heroes-iosandroid-covers-that-shine-bright/"><u>[New] Highlight Heroes IOS/Android Covers That Shine Bright</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-how-to-add-border-to-instagram-photos-with-best-apps/"><u>[New] In 2024, How to Add Border to Instagram Photos with Best Apps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/n-2024-seamless-addition-youtube-videos-into-google-slides/"><u>[New] In 2024, Seamless Addition YouTube Videos Into Google Slides</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-from-audience-to-advocate-strategies-for-powerful-fb-covers/"><u>[Updated] From Audience to Advocate Strategies for Powerful FB Covers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/11-proven-solutions-to-fix-google-play-store-not-working-issue-on-honor-magic-v2-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>11 Proven Solutions to Fix Google Play Store Not Working Issue on Honor Magic V2 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/2024-approved-leveraging-background-footage-for-engaging-content/"><u>2024 Approved Leveraging Background Footage for Engaging Content</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/2024-approved-mastering-digital-media-xmlttml-conversion-guide-for-srt/"><u>2024 Approved Mastering Digital Media XML/TTML Conversion Guide for SRT</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/2024-approved-navigating-zoom-to-elevate-your-facebook-lives/"><u>2024 Approved Navigating Zoom to Elevate Your Facebook Lives</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/2024-approved-premium-mix-picture-taking-plus-sounds-recorder-titles/"><u>2024 Approved Premium Mix Picture Taking + Sounds Recorder Titles</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/2024-approved-prime-practices-for-streaming-live-cricket-events/"><u>2024 Approved Prime Practices for Streaming Live Cricket Events</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/2024-approved-techniques-for-non-linear-eq-curves/"><u>2024 Approved Techniques for Non-Linear EQ Curves</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-top-11-supplements-for-dji-phantom-4-users/"><u>2024 Approved The Top 11 Supplements for DJI Phantom 4 Users</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/2024-approved-top-10-creative-ai-solutions-for-podcast-names-online/"><u>2024 Approved Top 10 Creative AI Solutions for Podcast Names Online</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/2024-approved-unveiling-av1-foundations-and-fundamentals/"><u>2024 Approved Unveiling AV1 Foundations and Fundamentals</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/a-detailed-guide-on-making-gifs-into-stickers-whatsapp-discord-and-telegram-edition/"><u>A Detailed Guide on Making GIFs Into Stickers WhatsApp, Discord & Telegram Edition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/does-find-my-friends-work-on-oppo-find-x6-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Does find my friends work on Oppo Find X6 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/1725284651596-dvd/"><u>DVDを集約して楽に保管!初心者でも簡単な組み立て方法</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/how-to-screen-mirroring-vivo-y100t-drfone-by-drfone-android/"><u>How to Screen Mirroring Vivo Y100t?

Makes Adjustments"></a>1. Makes Adjustments</h3><p>Before starting with editing your picture, the first rule is to crop the picture by making appropriate pictures. Make sure that the angle of your photo is correct and straight by removing the unwanted edges and objects from the frame. Your subject should be at the center so that it can instantly catch a viewer’s attention. You can do this entire process manually or automatically on the VSCO Photo Editor.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/vsco-photo-editor-2.jpg"                      alt="vsco crop tool"                ></p><h3 id="2-Control-the-Light-Exposure"><a href="#2-Control-the-Light-Exposure" class="headerlink" title="2. Control the Light Exposure"></a>2. Control the Light Exposure</h3><p>Light exposure is the other significant element of the picture as a perfect light exposure draws attention and seems pleasant to the eyes. Many times, individuals capture photos in daylight or in a room where the light exposure is minimum. If your subject is not illuminated perfectly, you can effectively control the light exposure through the VSCO Photo Editor.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/vsco-photo-editor-3.jpg"                      alt="adjust light exposure"                ></p><h3 id="3-Adjust-the-White-Balance"><a href="#3-Adjust-the-White-Balance" class="headerlink" title="3.

Split the Tone"></a>6. Split the Tone</h3><p>Do you want to give your picture a vibrant look? Use the exclusive feature of “Split Tone” by VSCO Photo Editor to add two colors to the shadows and highlights of your picture. You can create a contemporary image with more vibrant shadows and highlights through this option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/vsco-photo-editor-7.jpg"                      alt="vsco split the tone feature"                ></p><h3 id="7-Control-the-Saturation"><a href="#7-Control-the-Saturation" class="headerlink" title="7.

Subscriber trust creator’s opinions and can learn about new products in just a few minutes. Branded content and sponsored video are a great way to make additional revenue from your YouTube sponsor and grow your YouTube channel. As long as you have an engaged audience, its possible to secure sponsored content opportunities on YouTube.</p><p>Most content creator rely on sponsorship to make money from YouTube these days. The good news is that even if you have small channel this is still an option that’s available to you.</p><p>In this article, we’ll tell you exactly how to get sponsored on YouTube.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="What-is-Sponsored-video"><a href="#What-is-Sponsored-video" class="headerlink" title="What is Sponsored video"></a>What is Sponsored video</h2><p>Product sponsorship are when a brand sends you a free product to review. Product reviews are often the first sponsorship type a creator experience. Paid sponsorships are the highest level of YouTube sponsorship, you promote product or service on your channel in exchange for payment. They’re more likely to come your way once you’ve started to grow your channel.</p><p>Youtubers collaborate or accept sponsorship with the brand that fit their channel genre and personal interest so the sponsored videos resonate with their subscriber and target audience.</p><h2 id="Ways-to-Have-Sponsored-Product"><a href="#Ways-to-Have-Sponsored-Product" class="headerlink" title="Ways to Have Sponsored Product"></a>Ways to Have Sponsored Product</h2><h3 id="Focus-on-your-content"><a href="#Focus-on-your-content" class="headerlink" title="Focus on your content"></a>Focus on your content</h3><p>Given that you created now your YouTube channel, make sure to make a video that focus on what your niche or content. Think about what companies and products would be the most relevant, enjoyable, and valuable to your viewers. Example you like to talk about skin care products. Make sure that at least your first 10 videos focus about skin care. Or maybe make a video that relatable to everyone, but if you want products sponsorships do some products review on your channel. You will find your target audience if your consistent on the video you are creating. Products sponsors may come your way if you are consistent even if you have small audience or subscribers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/focus-on-video-content.jpg"                      alt="focus on video content"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118322/7443" target="_top" id="2118322">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118322" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118322/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2037319/7443" target="_top" id="2037319">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2037319" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2037319/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Invest-in-your-video"><a href="#Invest-in-your-video" class="headerlink" title="Invest in your video"></a>Invest in your video</h3><p>I personally, before the brand noticed my channel, i invested in products that i will review on my channel. I buy to try and do a review because i know someday this brand will noticed or watch my video and in this way i also got a chance to practice my speaking skills in front of the camera. If you are just starting this career, no one will come right away to sponsor you, so you need to make a way to get noticed and this is one way for you to be able to have a product sponsorship.</p><p>Essentially, you should think of your channel as your portfolio that brands will see before deciding to collaborate. The more professional your channel looks, the more opportunities you could have.</p><p>Don’t rush everything or you’re get tired right away. the first thing you have to do is make a hard effort to create quality content so that your channel will stand out from others. Remember there are a lot of content creator doing the same products review. The only thing you will do is make your own style and make sure you’re not copying others.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/invest-in-your-video.jpg"                      alt="invest in your video"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2100526/7443" target="_top" id="2100526">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2100526" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2100526/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Reach-out-to-Brands"><a href="#Reach-out-to-Brands" class="headerlink" title="Reach out to Brands"></a>Reach out to Brands</h3><p>The best way to get a sponsorship, especially for products reviewing, is by reaching out to the brands.</p><p>You can make an email and send it to the target brand but make sure you created a personalized email. Always do research about the brand and if possible, create a video that you are using or reviewing their products. Some brands are more likely to offer a sponsorship to creator who are using their products.</p><p>Make a sponsorship proposal to offer a business with the brand, include in the letter the benefits of the brand on sponsoring on you channel, give them the positive output and an eagerness that you can help them increase their sales by doing a product review on your channel. But make sure that all Brand you’re reaching out is the brand you tried and tested. Don’t ever collaborate to the brand that you don’t like to.</p><p>You should already have several videos on your channel before you approach brands, and it’s important to demonstrate that you have a consistent posting schedule. Brand want to get their products and services in front of potential buyers, so you’ll need to show that your videos have views.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/reach-out-to-brands.jpg"                      alt="reach out to brands"                ></p><h3 id="Contact-Information"><a href="#Contact-Information" class="headerlink" title="Contact Information"></a>Contact Information</h3><p>Don’t forget to always put your contact information in each of your video, you can use the description box to put your contact details like your, email address, Facebook account page, Instagram account where they can direct message you and your other social media. Just put all information where brand can contact you in case, they want to offer you a products collaboration or sponsorships. Often</p><h3 id="Make-Stand-out-Video"><a href="#Make-Stand-out-Video" class="headerlink" title="Make Stand out Video"></a>Make Stand out Video</h3><p>There is brand that watch the videos of their target content creator, especially when you email them about sponsorships, they watch your video first before doing business with you. That is why It is essential that you create a high-quality video that will attract more sponsorship. Just add some good element, transition and effects on your video that make attractive and creative.

Simply put, always work with high-quality cameras and equipment in a clean and aesthetically pleasing space.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/unboxing-reels-on-instagram-3.jpg"                      alt="use good recording equipment"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-2-Keep-the-Focus-on-the-Product-Throughout-the-Video-1"><a href="#Tip-2-Keep-the-Focus-on-the-Product-Throughout-the-Video-1" class="headerlink" title="Tip 2: Keep the Focus on the Product Throughout the Video"></a>Tip 2: Keep the Focus on the Product Throughout the Video</h3><p>Make sure to set the focus of your camera before recording reels. <strong>Unboxing the Instagram</strong> page should always focus on showing the product in higher quality. Imagine you shoot a video of a makeup box from Sephora, and if the focus is not on the box but on the table, do you think viewers will like it? They will ultimately bounce back, impacting your page’s followers and reels.</p><p>Thus, always give first priority to the product. It will be a positive thing for your unboxing influencer career. Keep your camera neat and clean, and check its focus from time to time while shooting the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/unboxing-reels-on-instagram-4.jpg"                      alt="have a proper angle of the product"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134503/19576" target="_top" id="2134503">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19576-2134503" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134503/19576"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Tip-3-Keep-the-Video-Short-1"><a href="#Tip-3-Keep-the-Video-Short-1" class="headerlink" title="Tip 3: Keep the Video Short"></a>Tip 3: Keep the Video Short</h3><p>This is very important that you do not exceed the time of Instagram reels.

It will help you give high-quality short and precise unboxing reels. Users can get what they are looking for in a limited time.</p><h3 id="Tip-4-Resize-your-Unboxing-Reels-to-Fit-Instagram-1"><a href="#Tip-4-Resize-your-Unboxing-Reels-to-Fit-Instagram-1" class="headerlink" title="Tip 4: Resize your Unboxing Reels to Fit Instagram"></a>Tip 4: Resize your Unboxing Reels to Fit Instagram</h3><p>The ideal size of Instagram’s <strong>unboxing reels</strong> is 1080x1920p. Confirm this resolution before posting a video so you will not face any problems in the future. Above all, there are both landscape and portrait reels, but the reliable ones are portrait. Posting the unboxing video in portrait mode will drive more followers to your page.</p><h3 id="Tip-5-Add-Captions-for-Your-Unboxing-Reels-1"><a href="#Tip-5-Add-Captions-for-Your-Unboxing-Reels-1" class="headerlink" title="Tip 5: Add Captions for Your Unboxing Reels"></a>Tip 5: Add Captions for Your Unboxing Reels</h3><p>Unboxing captions for Instagram can be a very helpful thing for many users. If a user is deaf, he will definitely need captions because of hearing impairment. Other than this, many people love to watch videos without voices, so it can be a complementary thing for you. When you add captions to an Instagram reel, it will assist you in standing apart from your competitors.</p><p>People can get what you are saying more clearly. Moreover, not everyone can understand English, so captions can help them out in this scenario. Unboxing videos with captions will not affect the video’s quality but will attract more followers to your page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/unboxing-reels-on-instagram-5.jpg"                      alt="add captions to reels"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-6-Choose-an-Appealing-Soundtrack-to-Tie-Everything-Together-1"><a href="#Tip-6-Choose-an-Appealing-Soundtrack-to-Tie-Everything-Together-1" class="headerlink" title="Tip 6: Choose an Appealing Soundtrack to Tie Everything Together"></a>Tip 6: Choose an Appealing Soundtrack to Tie Everything Together</h3><p>Soundtracks increase your chances of going viral and help you promote a brand. A soothing soundtrack can improve engagement and also attract music lovers. Alongside the unboxing captions, music is also a must-have for Instagram reels. Thus, select a piece of music that is like a melody to the ears.</p><p>Don’t try to add beatbox sounds in the videos because it will not suit them. However, you have to select a sound that matches the theme of your product. For example, selecting Disney music for toy unboxing Instagram is good. You can create an immersive and memorable user experience with an appealing soundtrack.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1915805/19272" target="_top" id="1915805">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1915805" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1915805/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Tip-7-Learn-More-From-Others-1"><a href="#Tip-7-Learn-More-From-Others-1" class="headerlink" title="Tip 7: Learn More From Others"></a>Tip 7: Learn More From Others</h3><p>There are uncountable <strong>unboxing reels</strong> on Instagram.

Users with Facebook profiles use it as an identifier for other sites, seeing and sharing their videos and images, and much more. For some users, the video they post may not have the right video speed and want to change it. For example, if the length of the video is too long or the main person presenting the video is a slow speaker.</p><p>Unfortunately, there is no preset setting on Facebook to increase the playback speed. So, <strong>can you speed up Facebook videos</strong> still?</p><p>The answer is yes, mainly with the help of other tools. In this article, let’s discuss the <strong>Facebook video speed controller</strong> options and how to carry out the process. Learn the step-by-step procedure and methods to carry it out on various device types here.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/deep-dive-into-the-best-ways-to-speed-up-facebook-videos-1.jpg"                      alt="add an extension for increasing video speed"                ></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="The-Best-Solutions-for-Changing-the-Speed-of-Videos-on-Facebook"><a href="#The-Best-Solutions-for-Changing-the-Speed-of-Videos-on-Facebook" class="headerlink" title="The Best Solutions for Changing the Speed of Videos on Facebook"></a>The Best Solutions for Changing the Speed of Videos on Facebook</h2><p>Multiple suitable solutions are available for users to try changing the Facebook videos they watch or play.
