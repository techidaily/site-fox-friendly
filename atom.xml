    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Bridging-the-Gap-From-Rgb-to-Standardized-Srgb"><a href="#Bridging-the-Gap-From-Rgb-to-Standardized-Srgb" class="headerlink" title="Bridging the Gap: From Rgb to Standardized Srgb"></a>Bridging the Gap: From Rgb to Standardized Srgb</h2><p>You might have seen the phrase “color space” in your preferred post-processing program or camera settings. It alludes to the spectrum of colors that a photograph is capable of displaying. The two most popular color spaces are typically sRGB and Adobe RGB.</p><p>It’s critical to understand the differences between these color spaces because they aren’t always equivalent. Every option has scenarios when it is more suitable than others. Let’s compare the sRGB and Adobe RGB color spaces and examine how these concepts are used in photography. Let’s start!</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e4Nt2xXXtmE?si=CtKwFry4b0AJXnaN" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-sRGB"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-sRGB" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Is sRGB?"></a>Part 1. What Is sRGB?</h2><p>Microsoft and HP created the sRGB RGB color space specifically for digital use. For computer screens and other digital devices like tablets and smartphones, it is the best color space to use. sRGB is now the standard color space as a result. SRGB is used by anything with computer-like skills.</p><p>All devices show sRGB images reliably, and it is easy to use. Additionally, it works well for printing from your neighborhood color lab. A computer monitor can display the majority of the sRGB color space, but only roughly 3&#x2F;4 of the Adobe RGB color space.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Is-Adobe-RGB"><a href="#Part-2-What-Is-Adobe-RGB" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. What Is Adobe RGB?"></a>Part 2. What Is Adobe RGB?</h2><p>Adobe created Adobe RGB so that it would work with CMYK printers. It contains the same number of colors as sRGB, as was already explained, but they are distributed differently. So if you want to print your work properly, it gives you a wider range of vivid color to work with. Their main advantage is this. They can also be changed at any time to sRGB.</p><p>You’ll see that when you submit a photo with an Adobe RGB color space to the web, the results appear flat and desaturated. This is due to the color being converted to sRGB by your browser. You should convert your files yourself before posting them because it does this fairly poorly.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vFQCEZiYA08?si=xjIu5IAy77RlHWii" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-Which-color-space-is-the-best"><a href="#Part-3-Which-color-space-is-the-best" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Which color space is the best?"></a>Part 3. Which color space is the best?</h2><p>The color space that best suits your needs is, as you might expect, the ideal color space. I advise setting your camera’s color space to Adobe RGB. This will provide you with a larger range of colors to work with while editing and enable you to convert your files to sRGB later if you wish. Adobe RGB files are fantastic because it’s simple to change them into sRGB for screen use. If you’ve ever sent pictures to stock photo agencies, for instance, you know that they typically want them in the Adobe RGB color space. The reason for this is that a customer acquiring a photo license has the option of printing the file or converting it to sRGB for usage on the web. Given that Adobe RGB’s color spectrum is wider, you have more alternatives. Color space will also be influenced by your display. A larger color gamut is displayed on some monitors than on others. A similar number of colors are present in both SRGB and Adobe RGB, however, sRGB has a smaller color space. According to reports, Adobe RGB has a 35% broader color spectrum than sRGB.</p><p>Professional printers also have preferences when it comes to the color spaces they need. Save your files in the Adobe RGB color space if you mostly operate in web form but believe that you may need the greater color gamut that Adobe RGB can offer in the future.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XA_wP7rS9ww?si=LarMG3sEHAhSoL6q" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-FAQs-about-RGB"><a href="#Part-4-FAQs-about-RGB" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

Therefore, from the standpoint of a review, it is geared toward the advanced amateur, the aspirant professional, and the full-fledged professional.</p><p>As a result, it provides extensive color grading and correction, professional special effects, and postproduction tools. MAGIX Video Pro X is optimized to generate video, picture, and audio at broadcast studio quality and features a configurable user interface for a customized workflow.</p><p>With that said, let’s start!</p><h3 id="User-friendly"><a href="#User-friendly" class="headerlink" title="User-friendly"></a>User-friendly</h3><p>Before you can access the main application for MAGIX Movie Edit Pro, you must first download the installer. In addition to this utility, it also tries to install several additional things, which we urge you to reject.

After that is finished, you can start.</p><p>As you learn how to use Movie Edit Pro, you might want to download the manual. Additionally, there is an introduction movie that is easily accessed from the help menu. More than 300 pages large and jam-packed with knowledge make up the guidebook. But not everyone wants to read a novel in order to understand how to operate a piece of software.</p><p>When we decided to use the opening video, a screen asking us to select our country appeared. Only South Africa, Australia, Australia, and the United Kingdom were available, though. A country selection screen with such a narrow focus has never been seen before.</p><p>Americans should not be concerned, despite the fact that they might not enjoy having to appear to be from a different country in order to view the accompanying materials as all of the links lead to the same collection of videos.</p><p>Ironically, the videos convey a vibe that is similar to 1980s American television. It doesn’t matter if the narrator’s instructions don’t always match what is happening on screen.</p><p>Despite the peculiarity of the support material, there is a lot of it, making it easy to locate what you need. You may also click on specific screen elements to get a more in-depth description of them using the contextual help menu in MAGIX.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/omWG4u39lmE?si=yk1AEo_gzDpGjYbl" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Projects"><a href="#Projects" class="headerlink" title="Projects"></a>Projects</h3><p>There are various perspectives on projects.

It is the most practical strategy and how we prefer to work.</p><p>You can quickly apply transitions and subtitles, as well as chop and move your clips from the timeline. Drag these items from the selection box to the appropriate clip, then change the settings as necessary to add them. You might need assistance becoming organized if you’re working on your film alongside others. The best project management tools can aid in team coordination.</p><p>Movie Edit occasionally makes things more difficult than they need to be. It loses some points for that because for some reason it interferes with the print-screen button’s typical operation, causing a superfluous pop-up to appear and frequently preventing screenshots from being taken.</p><p>Although there are UI peculiarities, we didn’t really encounter any errors with its standard editing tools. Dragging transitions to the timeline appears to completely replace your movie, and on one instance, we were unable to undo it to return to the previous position.</p><p>It’s not as simple as using other tools when you want to rearrange layers. It’s simple to create and rearrange layers in most editors, but we struggled to do so here and encountered problems when we tried to apply effects to various portions of our film.</p><p>Additionally, we discovered that occasionally nothing happened after picking an item from the menu, which was typically connected to online or external services.

A minimum 2.4 GHz processor, 4 GB of RAM, and a graphics card with 512 MB of memory are required.</p><p>We used our usual set of clips and settings to assess its rendering rates. Our test version had a license issue, so we were forced to output to the AVI format instead of the MPEG we usually use.</p><p>It also failed to generate our source clips at 60 frames per second. Our test system contains a 16GB memory stick, an Intel i5-7600 processor, and a 6GB graphics card. Storage is handled by an SSD.</p><p>Compared to HitFilm, their speeds are twice as rapid. Although Movie Edit Pro is slower than  Ultimate, the results are of considerably higher quality. Even though we were unable to produce at 60 frames per second, it still accomplishes what it can quickly. Even after upscaling to 1080p, the video quality of the output was good.</p><h3 id="File-formats"><a href="#File-formats" class="headerlink" title="File formats"></a>File formats</h3><p>Although not as extensive as  Ultimate, that is still a respectable array of formats. Despite having troubles with the MJPEG output, we produced very high-quality AVI videos for our tests. No importation difficulties were discovered.</p><h3 id="Resources"><a href="#Resources" class="headerlink" title="Resources"></a>Resources</h3><p>A few helpful functions are tucked away in the menus of Movie Edit Pro. You can find various extras that can enhance your output by going to “edit &gt; wizards.”</p><p>There is only one template available for choosing in the slideshow maker’s template drop-down menu by default, so until you go to the store, you’re stuck with “chillout.” However, it’s not required that you utilize a template. You may change a number of variables to personalize your presentation. There is an option for intensity, and you may select a music, as well as transitions and effects.</p><p>For us to use the soundtrack creator, we needed to install another module. You can make music in a number of styles and add “emotions” at particular places in your video, but we were unable to do this in our test version. If you can, however, you can do this.</p><p>Though, once more, we discovered that this didn’t work for us right out of the box, Movie E dit Pro also features travel-route animation tools. When we attempted to use it, nothing happened.</p><p>A link to MAGIX Photo Designer is included in the menu of Movie Edit Pro, and you have the option of installing Music Maker alongside it. Although Music Maker is currently discounted from $99 to $99, Photo Designer is free. If you’re interested in making images or music to go with your movies, these are both useful additions that you should consider.</p><p>The MAGIX Speed burnR program appears after selecting “share &gt; backup to CD or DVD” from the menu. We hadn’t previously seen this in the menus, but you can now burn to Blu-ray as well.</p><h3 id="Pricing"><a href="#Pricing" class="headerlink" title="Pricing"></a>Pricing</h3><p>There are various software versions available for potential Movie Edit Pro owners to select from. For video editing software, the Pro edition costs at $69.99, while the Plus and Premium versions are priced at $99.99 and $129.00, respectively.</p><p>Extra transitions, templates, and effects are included in the Plus version. Additionally, it has extra features including direct editing, journey routes, and multicam and 360-degree editing. Additionally, the Premium version offers more effects.</p><p>You may sign up for a 30-day free trial without providing a credit card. Three-minute output videos are the only restriction on the trial version, but that’s more than enough to test it out. However, when we attempted to export an MPEG video, a pop-up informed us that the code was not available owing to license restrictions.</p><p>Beware: after joining MAGIX, we received a ton of junk mail. But to be fair, it ceased after you unsubscribed.</p><p>There is an in-app store as well. This includes different add-ons including templates, transitions, and a large variety of opening and outro animations. Additional soundtracks, photos, and other visual goodies are also available for purchase.</p><h3 id="Support"><a href="#Support" class="headerlink" title="Support"></a>Support</h3><p>The help menu offers a community contact option if you need immediate assistance. This approach provides you with a pop-up window to ask your inquiry without identifying the person you are asking. We wish to b e informed in advance whether our questions will be sent or placed someplace.</p><p>Through its help pop-up, we attempted to inquire about its peculiar print screen issue, but instead of entering a live chat, we were forwarded to its forum. Our search returned no results. Nevertheless, there are frequently responses to queries and in-depth discussions on the forum.</p><p>On the support website, you’ll also find some helpful tutorial videos, as well as a media section showcasing users’ works.</p><p>Fast and nearly instantaneous input response may be found in Movie Edit Pro. Despite not being as appealing at first glance, it has a more user-friendly design than some of its competitors. But with its more sophisticated functions, you can occasionally get yourself into trouble.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Movie Edit Pro is the David Lynch of the video editing world. It is eccentric and a little strange, but it can do amazing things. There were several problems we encountered, but none of them prevented us from using the tool. It excels at the fundamentals and offers a ton of extras and effects. It performs considerably better.</p><p>It gives off the impression that it was created by enthusiastic individuals who care deeply about what they are doing yet aren’t overly concerned with the competition. We would prefer Movie Edit Pro to HitFilm if it were free to edit videos quickly and easily for private use or a small YouTube audience. Having said that, for serious use, we favor HitFilm. Though there isn’t much there, both tools are useful and enjoyable.</p><p>Movie Edit Pro frequently feels and looks archaic, yet it performs well when it matters. Once you’ve figured it out, working with it is simple. It also contains a ton of features, effects, and choices.

We hadn’t previously seen this in the menus, but you can now burn to Blu-ray as well.</p><h3 id="Pricing-1"><a href="#Pricing-1" class="headerlink" title="Pricing"></a>Pricing</h3><p>There are various software versions available for potential Movie Edit Pro owners to select from. For video editing software, the Pro edition costs at $69.99, while the Plus and Premium versions are priced at $99.99 and $129.00, respectively.</p><p>Extra transitions, templates, and effects are included in the Plus version. Additionally, it has extra features including direct editing, journey routes, and multicam and 360-degree editing. Additionally, the Premium version offers more effects.</p><p>You may sign up for a 30-day free trial without providing a credit card. Three-minute output videos are the only restriction on the trial version, but that’s more than enough to test it out. However, when we attempted to export an MPEG video, a pop-up informed us that the code was not available owing to license restrictions.</p><p>Beware: after joining MAGIX, we received a ton of junk mail. But to be fair, it ceased after you unsubscribed.</p><p>There is an in-app store as well. This includes different add-ons including templates, transitions, and a large variety of opening and outro animations. Additional soundtracks, photos, and other visual goodies are also available for purchase.</p><h3 id="Support-1"><a href="#Support-1" class="headerlink" title="Support"></a>Support</h3><p>The help menu offers a community contact option if you need immediate assistance. This approach provides you with a pop-up window to ask your inquiry without identifying the person you are asking. We wish to b e informed in advance whether our questions will be sent or placed someplace.</p><p>Through its help pop-up, we attempted to inquire about its peculiar print screen issue, but instead of entering a live chat, we were forwarded to its forum. Our search returned no results. Nevertheless, there are frequently responses to queries and in-depth discussions on the forum.</p><p>On the support website, you’ll also find some helpful tutorial videos, as well as a media section showcasing users’ works.</p><p>Fast and nearly instantaneous input response may be found in Movie Edit Pro. Despite not being as appealing at first glance, it has a more user-friendly design than some of its competitors. But with its more sophisticated functions, you can occasionally get yourself into trouble.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Movie Edit Pro is the David Lynch of the video editing world. It is eccentric and a little strange, but it can do amazing things. There were several problems we encountered, but none of them prevented us from using the tool. It excels at the fundamentals and offers a ton of extras and effects. It performs considerably better.</p><p>It gives off the impression that it was created by enthusiastic individuals who care deeply about what they are doing yet aren’t overly concerned with the competition. We would prefer Movie Edit Pro to HitFilm if it were free to edit videos quickly and easily for private use or a small YouTube audience. Having said that, for serious use, we favor HitFilm. Though there isn’t much there, both tools are useful and enjoyable.</p><p>Movie Edit Pro frequently feels and looks archaic, yet it performs well when it matters. Once you’ve figured it out, working with it is simple. It also contains a ton of features, effects, and choices. Please share your thoughts in the comments if you’ve used this or any other video editors and have something to say about them.</p><p>Gratitude for reading.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-interconnecting-your-music-collection-across-services/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Interconnecting Your Music Collection Across Services</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-bridging-the-gap-from-rgb-to-standardized-srgb-for-2024/"><u>[New] Bridging the Gap From Rgb to Standardized Srgb for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-the-art-of-picking-aspect-ratios-for-media/"><u>[New] In 2024, The Art of Picking Aspect Ratios for Media</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-top-12-no-cost-high-end-video-apps-for-seamless-viewing-experience-pc-and-tabletsmartphone/"><u>[New] In 2024, Top 12 No-Cost High-End Video Apps for Seamless Viewing Experience (PC & Tablet/Smartphone)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-tech-talk-optimizing-for-the-apple-store-for-2024/"><u>[New] Tech Talk Optimizing for the Apple Store for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-unseen-underpinnings-of-user-interface-craftsmanship/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Unseen Underpinnings of User Interface Craftsmanship</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-elite-4k-televisions-the-ultimate-showdown-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Elite 4K Televisions – The Ultimate Showdown for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-snort-spree-top-10-viral-laughs-online/"><u>2024 Approved Snort Spree Top 10 Viral Laughs Online</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location.techidaily.com/9-best-free-android-monitoring-apps-to-monitor-phone-remotely-for-your-sony-xperia-10-v-drfone-by-drfone-virtual/"><u>9 Best Free Android Monitoring Apps to Monitor Phone Remotely For your Sony Xperia 10 V | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-howtos.techidaily.com/fix-for-pubg-architecture-loading-problems-gameplay-smoothened/"><u>Fix for PUBG Architecture Loading Problems -

This can be done using various devices, such as smart gloves, often known as data gloves.</p><p>In this article, we’ll discuss <strong>Hand Tracking</strong> technology, its various applications, and how to create it using Python, OpenCV, and Media Pipe.</p><ol><li><a href="#part2-1">Tracking With Interface</a></li><li><a href="#part2-2">Tracking Without Interface</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part3">Using Python, OpenCV, And MediaPipe To Create A Hand Tracking</a></li></ul><ol><li><a href="#part3-1">What is OpenCV</a>  </li><li><a href="#part3-2">What Is Media Pipe</a>  </li><li><a href="#part3-3">Guidance With Steps</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part4">Use Filmora to demonstarte your Hand Tracking skill</a></li></ul><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Hand-Tracking-Where-Is-It-Applied"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Hand-Tracking-Where-Is-It-Applied" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Is Hand Tracking? Where Is It Applied?"></a>Part 1. What Is Hand Tracking? Where Is It Applied?</h2><p>Hand Tracking refers to the process of tracking the position and movement of a user’s hands in virtual reality. This is usually done using a combination of sensors, including cameras, infrared sensors, or ultrasonic sensors.</p><p>By tracking the user’s hands, VR systems can provide more immersive and interactive experiences. For example, Hand Tracking can be used to allow users to interact with virtual objects, as well as to provide input for gestures and body language.</p><p>The Oculus Quest 2 is a virtual reality headset that immerses you in virtual worlds. Quest 2’s one of the coolest features is Hand Tracking, which lets you interact with the virtual world around you using your hands.</p><p>With Hand Tracking, you can interact with the virtual world more naturally and intuitively. You can use your hands to pick up objects, draw, and even type on a virtual keyboard. Moreover, it opens up new possibilities for gameplay, allowing you to play games in new and innovative ways.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/hand-tracking-technology.jpg"                      alt="hand tracking technology"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zXUt81WsQpI?si=W3DKIAsa2-qbGadJ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Types-Of-Hand-Tracking"><a href="#Part-2-Types-Of-Hand-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Types Of Hand Tracking"></a>Part 2. Types Of Hand Tracking</h2><p>There are two main types of Hand Tracking: with interface and without interface:</p><h3 id="Tracking-With-Interface"><a href="#Tracking-With-Interface" class="headerlink" title="Tracking With Interface"></a>Tracking With Interface</h3><p>With interface Hand Tracking, you need to use a device such as a glove or a controller to interact with the virtual world. This can be used in VR or AR applications. It is further divided into two systems:</p><p><strong>1. Inertial Motion Capture Gloves</strong></p><p>Inertial motion capture gloves use sensors Inertial Measurement Units or IMUs with built-in sensors to track the movement of your hands. These sensors include gyroscopes, accelerometers, and sometimes magnetometers for measuring angular rate, detecting gravitational force and acceleration, and measuring the earth’s magnetic field, respectively.</p><p>These gloves can be used for a variety of purposes, such as gaming, virtual reality, and motion capture for movies and video games. Inertial motion capture gloves are becoming increasingly popular as they offer a more immersive experience than traditional controllers.</p><p><strong>2. Optical Motion Capture Systems</strong></p><p>Optical motion capture is a process that uses cameras and reflective sensors to track movement in three-dimensional space. These systems are often used in movies and video games to create realistic animations.</p><p>Optical motion capture systems emit infrared light from the camera. The markers reflect light, which is then captured by cameras. The movement of the markers is then used to create a three-dimensional model of the object.</p><p>The more cameras used, the more accurate the results. While this technology is very precise, it can be limited by factors such as body position and movement.</p><h3 id="Tracking-Without-Interface"><a href="#Tracking-Without-Interface" class="headerlink" title="Tracking Without Interface"></a>Tracking Without Interface</h3><p>Also known as Markerless Hand Tracking, this type of Hand Tracking allows users to track their hand movements without the need for any external markers or data gloves, meaning more spontaneous interaction and freedom of movement. This could hugely impact everything from gaming to virtual reality to human-computer interaction.</p><p>Right now, markerless Hand Tracking is still in its early stages, with a few limitations. However, as this technology continues to develop, we will likely see more and more applications for it in the future.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Using-Python-OpenCV-And-MediaPipe-To-Create-A-Hand-Tracking"><a href="#Part-3-Using-Python-OpenCV-And-MediaPipe-To-Create-A-Hand-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Using Python, OpenCV, And MediaPipe To Create A Hand Tracking"></a>Part 3. Using Python, OpenCV, And MediaPipe To Create A Hand Tracking</h2><p>Above we have learned what is Hand Tracking and the two types of it. Now let’s see how we can create a hand tracking with two Python Libraries - OpenCV and MediaPipe.</p><p>Before we go further about them, let us learn about Python quickly. Python is a versatile language used for a wide range of tasks, including image processing and computer vision. We will use Python and two Python Libraries: OpenCV and MediaPipe, to create a Hand Tracking module.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/15TKQ-BOENI?si=Ri4B2AuxAdi0Bglz" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="What-is-OpenCV"><a href="#What-is-OpenCV" class="headerlink" title="What is OpenCV"></a>What is OpenCV</h3><p>To get a deeper understanding of OpenCV, please read our article: <em>Opencv Tracking, a compete review</em>.（同期交付文章，请插入相关内链~）</p><h3 id="What-Is-Media-Pipe"><a href="#What-Is-Media-Pipe" class="headerlink" title="What Is Media Pipe"></a>What Is Media Pipe</h3><p>Media Pipe is an open-source framework by Google that provides a set of tools for working with multimedia data or media processing.

What Is Hand Tracking? Where Is It Applied?"></a>Part 1. What Is Hand Tracking? Where Is It Applied?</h2><p>Hand Tracking refers to the process of tracking the position and movement of a user’s hands in virtual reality. This is usually done using a combination of sensors, including cameras, infrared sensors, or ultrasonic sensors.</p><p>By tracking the user’s hands, VR systems can provide more immersive and interactive experiences. For example, Hand Tracking can be used to allow users to interact with virtual objects, as well as to provide input for gestures and body language.</p><p>The Oculus Quest 2 is a virtual reality headset that immerses you in virtual worlds. Quest 2’s one of the coolest features is Hand Tracking, which lets you interact with the virtual world around you using your hands.</p><p>With Hand Tracking, you can interact with the virtual world more naturally and intuitively. You can use your hands to pick up objects, draw, and even type on a virtual keyboard. Moreover, it opens up new possibilities for gameplay, allowing you to play games in new and innovative ways.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/hand-tracking-technology.jpg"                      alt="hand tracking technology"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AQn0MYjIfyI?si=rIdjT-qMRpjpJXXa" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Types-Of-Hand-Tracking-1"><a href="#Part-2-Types-Of-Hand-Tracking-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Types Of Hand Tracking"></a>Part 2. Types Of Hand Tracking</h2><p>There are two main types of Hand Tracking: with interface and without interface:</p><h3 id="Tracking-With-Interface-1"><a href="#Tracking-With-Interface-1" class="headerlink" title="Tracking With Interface"></a>Tracking With Interface</h3><p>With interface Hand Tracking, you need to use a device such as a glove or a controller to interact with the virtual world. This can be used in VR or AR applications. It is further divided into two systems:</p><p><strong>1. Inertial Motion Capture Gloves</strong></p><p>Inertial motion capture gloves use sensors Inertial Measurement Units or IMUs with built-in sensors to track the movement of your hands. These sensors include gyroscopes, accelerometers, and sometimes magnetometers for measuring angular rate, detecting gravitational force and acceleration, and measuring the earth’s magnetic field, respectively.</p><p>These gloves can be used for a variety of purposes, such as gaming, virtual reality, and motion capture for movies and video games. Inertial motion capture gloves are becoming increasingly popular as they offer a more immersive experience than traditional controllers.</p><p><strong>2. Optical Motion Capture Systems</strong></p><p>Optical motion capture is a process that uses cameras and reflective sensors to track movement in three-dimensional space. These systems are often used in movies and video games to create realistic animations.</p><p>Optical motion capture systems emit infrared light from the camera. The markers reflect light, which is then captured by cameras. The movement of the markers is then used to create a three-dimensional model of the object.</p><p>The more cameras used, the more accurate the results. While this technology is very precise, it can be limited by factors such as body position and movement.</p><h3 id="Tracking-Without-Interface-1"><a href="#Tracking-Without-Interface-1" class="headerlink" title="Tracking Without Interface"></a>Tracking Without Interface</h3><p>Also known as Markerless Hand Tracking, this type of Hand Tracking allows users to track their hand movements without the need for any external markers or data gloves, meaning more spontaneous interaction and freedom of movement. This could hugely impact everything from gaming to virtual reality to human-computer interaction.</p><p>Right now, markerless Hand Tracking is still in its early stages, with a few limitations. However, as this technology continues to develop, we will likely see more and more applications for it in the future.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qObsqoJB9LI?si=ppqxfXzP0UL4J6Tp" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-Using-Python-OpenCV-And-MediaPipe-To-Create-A-Hand-Tracking-1"><a href="#Part-3-Using-Python-OpenCV-And-MediaPipe-To-Create-A-Hand-Tracking-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

A few years have passed since Guardians of Galaxy Vol. 2, the first full-feature movie shot in 8K was released, but in the meantime, only a few 8K cameras have emerged.</p><p>The industry-leading camera manufacturers like RED, Sharp or Ikegami have already released 8K cameras, but their prices are still too high for most cinematographers. So in this article, we are going to take a look closer look at some of the best 8k cameras you can find on the market in 2024 and see what they have to offer.</p><p>You may also like: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >11 Best Bridge Cameras [Ultimate Review] <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QPAKth3O_5c?si=3YDfzJAZMDp1gFRz" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-is-an-8K-Camera"><a href="#What-is-an-8K-Camera" class="headerlink" title="What is an 8K Camera?"></a>What is an 8K Camera?</h2><p>The <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >resolution <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>determines the maximum quality of pictures a video camera can capture. Each frame an 8K camera records can either have 7680 or 8192 pixels on the longer side of the frame and between 2160 and 8192 pixels on the shorter side of the frame depending on the video’s <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >aspect ratio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Commonly an 8K video with the standard 16:9 aspect ratio has 33.9 million pixels or a resolution of 7680x4320 pixels.</p><p>It is worth noting that the resolution of still images is different than the video resolution, as it is measured in megapixels. Technically, any camera that has more than 25 MP can capture photos that have 7680x3200 pixels, which means that models like <a class="link"   href="https://www.hasselblad.com/x1d/" >Hasselblad X1D II 50C <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or <a class="link"   href="https://www.usa.canon.com/internet/portal/us/home/products/details/cameras/eos-dslr-and-mirrorless-cameras/dslr/eos-5ds-r" >Canon EOS 5DS R <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can already take photos that have the same number of pixels like 8K videos. However, these medium format cameras cannot record videos in 8K resolution.</p><p>8K video cameras function on the same principle as <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >4K or Full HD cameras <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>as they utilize a lens and a sensor to record images on the camera’s memory card. Currently, the size of the files 8K cameras produce is one of the major reasons why cinematographers are still reluctant to embrace them since 40 minutes of footage can take up to 2 terabytes of storage space.</p><p>The images recorded with 8K cameras can be used for live broadcasts, in cinemas or they can be displayed on <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >8K television sets <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Even so, 4K and Full HD videos are still the industry standard and it remains to be seen if 8K technology is going to change that.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JAkb8Bv3AU4?si=2rHwnZYTzTLieKgY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Which-Aspects-Should-You-Consider-When-Choosing-an-8K-Camera"><a href="#Which-Aspects-Should-You-Consider-When-Choosing-an-8K-Camera" class="headerlink" title="Which Aspects Should You Consider When Choosing an 8K Camera?"></a>Which Aspects Should You Consider When Choosing an 8K Camera?</h2><p><strong>How Much Is An 8K Camera?</strong></p><p>At the moment only professional cinematographers have any reason to purchase an 8K camera, as the price of the least expensive models varies between $24,000 and $50,000. To make matters worse, the difference between 4K and 8K footage is only visible on TV sets and <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >monitors <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that can display videos that are recorded in 8K resolution.</p><p><strong>Which parameters should consider in choosing 8K camera?</strong></p><p>During the process of selecting an 8K camera you must go through the list of features, and check which <strong>sensor</strong> the camera has, how much <strong>storage space</strong> it offers or find out its <strong>maximum</strong> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><strong>frame rate</strong></a>. Most of the 8K camera models can capture footage at 60fps, although their <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >bit rates <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can vary, which impacts the speed at which data is transferred. Furthermore, you should pay attention to the camera’s lens mount type, since you must also acquire lenses for the 8K camera you are considering.</p><p>In case you are looking for a camera, you can use for broadcasting the speed at which the camera transfers the data or its SDI output are among the most important features you should consider, while if you are searching for a camera you will be using to shoot movies you must look into features like the maximum frame rate, camera’s shutter speed or the storage capacity.</p><h2 id="Best-8K-Cameras-on-the-Market-in-2024"><a href="#Best-8K-Cameras-on-the-Market-in-2024" class="headerlink" title="Best 8K Cameras on the Market in 2024"></a><strong>Best 8K Cameras on the Market in 2024</strong></h2><p>Even though 8K cameras have been on the market for the larger part of this decade, there are only a handful of models to choose from in 2024. Furthermore, most of the 8K camera models are too expensive, as it is still much more affordable to rent them than to purchase them. Here’s what some of the most prestigious camera manufacturers have to offer when it comes to 8K cameras.</p><h3 id="1-Canon"><a href="#1-Canon" class="headerlink" title="1. Canon"></a>1. Canon</h3><p>The rumors that Canon is working on its first 8K camera surfaced in early 2019, but as the year’s end approaches it is still unclear when and if the manufacturer will present its first 8K camera to the world. The Canon’s first 8K full-frame camera should have <strong>a CMOS sensor</strong> that resembles the Super 35mm sensor, although the exact specifications are still not available to the public.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canon-eos-5ds-r-dslr.jpg"                      alt="Canon EOS 5DS R DSLR Camera "                ></p><p>Image resource: Cannon</p><p>This camera should be capable of recording <strong>8K footage at 60 fps</strong>, as well as 4K footage at 120 fps, but whether or not this will turn out to be true still remains to be seen. However, a number of Canon’s models are already equipped with <strong>50MP</strong> sensors that can capture still images in resolutions that go as high as <strong>8712 x 5813</strong> or record videos in 4K resolution at 60fps.</p><p>Models like <a class="link"   href="https://www.usa.canon.com/internet/portal/us/home/products/details/cameras/eos-dslr-and-mirrorless-cameras/dslr/eos-5ds" >EOS 5DS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Canon-Mirrorless-Digital-Camera-Body/dp/B07H484HLT" >EOS R <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, are powerful enough to enable you to take still images at resolutions that resemble those provided by 8K cameras. However, the exact date when Canon is going to unveil their first 8K camera is still not known, but if any of the rumors are true it could easily happen that we are going to see the Canon’s first 8K camera in 2020.</p><h3 id="2-Nikon"><a href="#2-Nikon" class="headerlink" title="2. Nikon"></a>2. Nikon</h3><p>Even though Nikon is one of the leading camera manufacturers in the world, there are still no 8K Nikon cameras. After Apple’s WWDC event information surfaced that Nikon is developing a new 8K model, but this information has been dismissed as false soon after the event.</p><p>At the moment the <a class="link"   href="https://www.nikonusa.com/en/nikon-products/product/dslr-cameras/d850.html" >Nikon D850 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is the closest to an 8K camera this manufacturer has to offer since this 47.5 MP camera can record time-lapses in 8K resolution, although only by combining the footage captured with two D850 models.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/nikon-d850-8k-time-lapse-camera.jpg"                      alt="Nikon D850 8K Timelapse Camera "                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Iz2LYWd8EqI?si=G_3CqFRAmeVPczjj" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Image resource: Nikon</p><p>This Nikon’s camera has also 7fps continuous shooting mode as well as the capability to record 4K UHD videos at 30, 25 and 24 fps. Nikon D850 has an FX CMOS sensor that can capture images that have 8256 x 5504 pixels and the ISO sensitivity that ranges from ISO 64 to ISO 25,600.</p><p>The camera is compatible with G, E, and D AF Nikkor lenses as well as DX and AI-P lenses, which provides you with enough versatility to shoot virtually any scene you want. Whether or not Nikon is going to add 8K cameras to their assortment of products is not yet clear, and it may be a while until one of the largest camera manufacturers in the industry releases its first 8K camera.</p><h3 id="3-Sharp"><a href="#3-Sharp" class="headerlink" title="3. Sharp"></a>3. Sharp</h3><p>A few years ago, Sharp introduced 8C-B60A, the world’s first 8K camcorder and a few years later there are only a few cameras that have the features that can be compared to those you can find on the 8C-B60A camcorder.</p><p><strong>The Super 35mm equivalent single-plate CMOS sensor</strong> has approximately <strong>33 million pixels</strong>, while the <strong>quad-link 12G-SDI output terminal</strong> enables capturing and broadcasting footage live while the recording session is still in progress.</p><p>8C-B60A can record <strong>8K 10-bit videos at 60fps</strong>, although you can set the frame rate to 50, 30 or 24fps. The camcorder is also equipped with a <strong>2TB SSD pack</strong> that can store up to <strong>40 minutes of 8K footage</strong> and it offers the possibility to use the SDHC card for proxy recording. 8C-B60A utilizes the <strong>Grass Valley HQX Codec</strong> to compress the raw video files at a <strong>6 Gbps compression rate</strong>.</p><p>It features two <strong>AUDIO IN XLR type 3 pins</strong> and one <strong>MIC IN XLR type 5 pin</strong>. The camcorder doesn’t have batteries and it is powered through a <strong>130W 13V DC output AC&#x2F;DC adapter XLR 4-pin</strong>. The Sharp’s 8C-B60A 8K camcorder is undoubtedly one of the best 8K cameras you can buy in 2024, despite the hefty price tag.</p><h3 id="4-Sony"><a href="#4-Sony" class="headerlink" title="4.

Sony</h3><p>Professional cinematographers don’t need an introduction to Sony’s cameras, as the Japanese camera manufacturer has been at the forefront of the digital camera market for decades. Their <a class="link"   href="https://pro.sony/ue%5FUS/products/digital-cinema-cameras/f65#SATD501220TheF65Cinealta-f65" >F65 CineAlta <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> was released in 2016, but it is still one of the best 8K cameras you can buy in 2024. This speaks volumes about the F65’s capabilities, much like the fact that professional cinematographers have nothing but praise for this Sony’s camera model.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sony-f65-cineAlta-8k-camera.jpg"                      alt="Sony F65 CineAlta 8K Camera "                ></p><p>Image resource: Sony</p><p>The <strong>1-chip 20MP Super 35mm type</strong> <strong>24.7mm X 13.1mm</strong> <strong>CMOS sensor</strong> enables you to capture videos in 8K, 4K or 2K resolutions. The camera’s <strong>PL lens mount</strong> is standard for all film cameras, which means that you won’t have too much trouble finding the lens you can use with F65 CineAlta.</p><p>The camera has <strong>14 stops of exposure latitude</strong>, so if you are shooting RAW video files F65 will utilize the <strong>S-Log3&#x2F;S-Gamut3 gamma curve</strong> to ensure accurate color depiction. In addition, this 8K camera can capture <strong>275,000,000,000,000 color variations</strong> even while you are shooting in full resolution at 60fps. Unsurprisingly, F65 CineAlta costs more than $60.000, but it is still a great investment for all professional filmmakers in need of a camera that can deliver great performances regardless of the available light.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OFDHJnZLwTA?si=WThcb2h76AnZDzcQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="5-Ikegami"><a href="#5-Ikegami" class="headerlink" title="5.

The SHK-810’s output signal features are equally impressive since you can choose between <strong>SHV Dual Green SDI Interface, 4K SMPTE 424M (3G-SDI) Level B and HD SMPTE 292M</strong> options.</p><p>In addition, you can choose between <strong>2-channel x 4K and 4-channel HD</strong> return signals or opt for <strong>Tri-Level Sync</strong> or <strong>VBS</strong> external sync signals. However, SHK-810 is bulky and heavy, as it weighs 9kg or 19.6 lbs without a viewfinder which makes it difficult to use without a tripod during events that last for several hours. Moreover, the camera is aimed at large television networks rather than filmmakers and cinematographers, and at the moment Ikegami doesn’t offer any 8K camera models that are designed for filmmaking purposes.</p><h3 id="6-Red"><a href="#6-Red" class="headerlink" title="6.

These are commonly used in logo design, with images made of curves, lines, and points that come together based on a mathematical formula to form vibrant and non-pixelated digital artwork.</p><p>If you plan to create branded digital logos, you should know what they are and their difference from raster images. Here, we will discuss that specifically, including the types and software options to help create stunning ones. Let’s get started.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/beginners-guide-to-all-things-vector-images-overview-types-and-software-choices-1.jpg"                      alt="vector image vs zoomed in image in bitmap image"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YB7Ou4-iKVM?si=7Fq8iUwI8voccMLx" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-I-The-Art-of-Vector-Images"><a href="#Part-I-The-Art-of-Vector-Images" class="headerlink" title="Part I.

That is precisely what we will discuss here, beginning with what stands for vector as a picture format.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AcAYRX0cwwA?si=DxqWU39vqksZbe1s" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="What-are-Vector-Images"><a href="#What-are-Vector-Images" class="headerlink" title="What are Vector Images?"></a>What are Vector Images?</h3><p>A vector image is a graphics-based file format made of a group of points with lines to join them. The vector drawing program’s point-to-point illustration helps create complex and straightforward line-based geometric shapes. Therefore, when you see the images, it looks smoother and barely pixelated when zoomed into the image.</p><p>Users can add gradients and solid color within the shapes, and all of its information, like the point coordination and how the shape is filled, is stored via mathematical equations. In graphic design, the computer uses mathematical data to render the vector image. For this, it connects the “Paths” (lines) and fills within the shape with color.</p><p>Currently, many professional editors use top-quality <strong>software to create vector images</strong> for digital objects with optimized geometrical precision. It is commonly used in areas like typography, 3D rendering, and engineering, all of which require software that can decompose complex data into simplified geometric primitives.</p><p>The common types of these images that graphic designers and other professionals work with now are WMF, SVG, EPS, CDR, PDF, or AI-based graphic files. But most people deal with raster images, so they do not have some confusion about what vector files are.</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Bitmap Images</strong></th><th><strong>Vector Images</strong></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>WHAT IS</strong></td><td>Bitmap or Vector images are arranged in a grid pattern of multi-colored pixels to form an image.Examples include BMP, GIF, APNG, JPEG&#x2F;JPG, MPEG4, and WebP.</td><td>Vector images are a graphical type of image format which is made of geometric shapes on a type of cartesian place, including elements like curves, lines, points, and polygons.Examples include WMF, SVG, EPS, CDR, and PDF.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>PROS</strong></td><td>1. The images are easier to produce and distribute across platforms, devices, and other conventional input-output devices, like scanners, inkjet printers, etc.2. It is compatible with different types of image types, like posters to small badges.3. These have very high processing speeds.4. Users can create different types of images without any concern about complexity.</td><td>1. Best for graphic design artwork, like branded logos and documents.2. When you zoom the images, there are no noticeable pixels and the image still looks smooth.3. When you try to decrease or increase a digitized object, the lines with pre-specified width is not controlled as per the image size.4. It is easier to scale, move, or rotate the vector images without affecting image quality.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>CONS</strong></td><td>1. It only looks natural when seeing the images on a small scale or from far. When zoomed, the pictures look pixelated and rougher.2. Blurry appearance.</td><td>1. Showing the image in low resolution has a different level of quality.2.

These days, most computers have built-in webcams, so one of the easiest ways to start recording video is to use a webcam.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/best-webcam-for-podcast-1.jpg"                      alt="podcast camera"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lp78eFEGwVU?si=-4orJBLvJJrggCJ2" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Webcams are inexpensive, easy to set up, and usually already come pre-loaded with software that will allow you to record video and audio for your podcast.</p><h2 id="What-to-expect-from-a-webcam-for-podcasting"><a href="#What-to-expect-from-a-webcam-for-podcasting" class="headerlink" title="What to expect from a webcam for podcasting?"></a>What to expect from a webcam for podcasting?</h2><p>Adding video to your podcasts can help them stand out. However, just like with other forms of webcasting, there’s no guarantee that you will have the best audio quality out of the box. Here are four things you can expect from your webcam when doing a podcast:</p><h3 id="1-Field-of-view"><a href="#1-Field-of-view" class="headerlink" title="(1) Field of view"></a>(1) Field of view</h3><p>It’s essential to keep the field of view (FOV) wide enough so obstacles do not block the camera, even if those obstructions are large. On the other hand, if the FOV is too narrow, the camera may be unable to capture all of the scenery in front of it, thus missing key elements of your shot. Also, a wider FOV will produce a more dramatic picture and give your audience a better sense of the setting.</p><h3 id="2-Picture-quality"><a href="#2-Picture-quality" class="headerlink" title="(2) Picture quality"></a>(2) Picture quality</h3><p>The quality of a webcam will determine how much it can be used for video-conferencing, recording video and audio, and live-streaming events. The quality of a webcam is defined by its resolution (the higher, the better), frame rate, dynamic range, and noise levels. The resolution of a webcam is measured in pixels per inch. High-resolution webcams have 1280 x 720-pixel resolution, while lower-quality ones have 640 x 480 resolution.</p><h3 id="3-Companion-software"><a href="#3-Companion-software" class="headerlink" title="(3) Companion software"></a>(3) Companion software</h3><p>Most webcams include a companion app or downloadable software that will make them even more versatile and powerful. The final product will look much better. You can add your music to your videos, text your podcasts and other media, or edit and remix your audio and video recordings using the editing features. And you know what the most exciting part about webcam companion software is?

Is my laptop’s camera good enough for podcasting?</h3><p>Every laptop webcam will do for a podcast, but not all laptops have the same capabilities. A good quality webcam can capture high-definition (HD) video at up to 30 frames per second (fps). That is necessary for high-end applications, such as recording software and Skype. If the laptop’s webcam supports the same or better features, then it’s good to go for a podcast.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YezPJZzPJ8Q?si=xF1t4BQHFquzvnzE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-Is-high-definition-necessary"><a href="#2-Is-high-definition-necessary" class="headerlink" title="2.

However, just like with other forms of webcasting, there’s no guarantee that you will have the best audio quality out of the box. Here are four things you can expect from your webcam when doing a podcast:</p><h3 id="1-Field-of-view-1"><a href="#1-Field-of-view-1" class="headerlink" title="(1) Field of view"></a>(1) Field of view</h3><p>It’s essential to keep the field of view (FOV) wide enough so obstacles do not block the camera, even if those obstructions are large. On the other hand, if the FOV is too narrow, the camera may be unable to capture all of the scenery in front of it, thus missing key elements of your shot. Also, a wider FOV will produce a more dramatic picture and give your audience a better sense of the setting.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HaM818fFKXQ?si=ZZLA4lFSHSgCpSE0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-Picture-quality-1"><a href="#2-Picture-quality-1" class="headerlink" title="(2) Picture quality"></a>(2) Picture quality</h3><p>The quality of a webcam will determine how much it can be used for video-conferencing, recording video and audio, and live-streaming events. The quality of a webcam is defined by its resolution (the higher, the better), frame rate, dynamic range, and noise levels. The resolution of a webcam is measured in pixels per inch. High-resolution webcams have 1280 x 720-pixel resolution, while lower-quality ones have 640 x 480 resolution.</p><h3 id="3-Companion-software-1"><a href="#3-Companion-software-1" class="headerlink" title="(3) Companion software"></a>(3) Companion software</h3><p>Most webcams include a companion app or downloadable software that will make them even more versatile and powerful.

This is an ideal solution if you don’t want your title to distract from the main content;</p><p>Step1 Start by creating a new composition and then go to the crosshair icon under the preview window and select “Title&#x2F;Action Safe.” This enables “Title Safe” which will add a guide to the screen to make sure your titles remain in the correct place.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/line-title-animation-ae.jpg"                      alt="line title animation ae"                ></p><p>Step2 Click on the Text Tool and type in your title.

Animating the Lines</em></strong></p><p>If you would like to animate the lines, follow these steps;</p><p>Step1 Move the playhead to 1 second and click on the “Stopwatch” on the start icon.

It helps them to adjust video quality and bit rate to gain higher results. Hardware Encoders are usually difficult to upgrade but when we talk about software encoders then it is much easier to step ahead to new versions because easy upgrading facility is available.</p><h4 id="Pricing"><a href="#Pricing" class="headerlink" title="Pricing"></a>Pricing</h4><p> One of the most important thing to discuss about software encoders is their ability to serve with easy customization as per user needs and you will be glad to know that these tools are available at low price range comparatively. So many software encoders are available over internet and you can even get some of them for free. Adobe Flash Media Live Encoder tool is also available for free with all interactive features.</p><p> But the downside is that these tools lack somewhere in overall latency speed as compared to hardware encoders. As most of the time users keep on running multiple programs on their devices so it becomes difficult for encoder tools to access all desired resources freely.</p><h4 id="Users"><a href="#Users" class="headerlink" title="Users"></a>Users</h4><p><strong>Beginning Streamers:</strong> As we already discussed, Flash Live Media Encoder is available for free so beginners can access it to gain information about how these platforms actually work. This tool possesses so many incredible features and that is why it is being used by wide range of users throughout the world and they range from beginners to professionals.</p><p><strong>Live Sporting Events:</strong> These sporting events often take place in field or in gym areas so it is good to have least complexities involved with encoders. Software encoders are most suitable to such needs because they take minimum space with just a camera and computer. Wirecast works with few impressive sports specific features.</p><p><strong>Live Streaming from Home:</strong> If you are one of those broadcasters who rarely find time to update their live streams online then there is no need to spend on costly hardware arrangements rather free software encoder tools are most suitable for your needs.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o-sRtqHdEYY?si=NMTMQVxJsUaoguqh" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Live-Streaming-Hardware-Encoders"><a href="#Live-Streaming-Hardware-Encoders" class="headerlink" title="Live Streaming Hardware Encoders"></a>Live Streaming Hardware Encoders</h2><p> Hardware encoders are based upon dedicated processors and they follow specific algorithms for video encoding.

It has fixed, non-adjustable yet impressive video quality. Note that hardware encoders demand more time for development or design and many times manufacturers add older codecs into them. It makes them inflexible as well as restricted with non-customizable platforms.</p><h4 id="Pricing-1"><a href="#Pricing-1" class="headerlink" title="Pricing"></a>Pricing</h4><p> Latency and price point are two major factors that fit into comparison table of hardware and software encoders. You will not be able to get any hardware encoder for free like software encoders; but the price can be as low as up to $100. The professional encoders can be little expensive.</p><h4 id="Users-1"><a href="#Users-1" class="headerlink" title="Users"></a>Users</h4><p><strong>Production Companies:</strong> The most common application of hardware encoders in found in professional world due to their high price range, classic video quality and crisp details.</p><h4 id="Advantages-of-Hardware-Encoders"><a href="#Advantages-of-Hardware-Encoders" class="headerlink" title="Advantages of Hardware Encoders"></a>Advantages of Hardware Encoders</h4><ul><li>They provide highly responsive live mixing experience with much smoother graphic details.</li><li>High quality encoding, even up to 1080p resolution level.</li><li>They are simple to use and entire encoding process is automated.</li><li>You need not to worry about CPU usage, network security issues and memory.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fJlICvacgJY?si=jNeijBVj7ia4ammA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p> The best fit encoder can be picked up on the basis of desired features, specifications and budget range.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Diving-Into-Movavi’s-Premium-Video-Tools-Edition"><a href="#Diving-Into-Movavi’s-Premium-Video-Tools-Edition" class="headerlink" title="Diving Into Movavi’s Premium Video Tools Edition"></a>Diving Into Movavi’s Premium Video Tools Edition</h2><p>The objective of Movavi’s video editing software is to make it simple to create movies and clips, eschewing the sometimes-pointless complexity of the competition. Does that actually work in practice? It sounds fantastic, but After all, producing engaging movies frequently calls for sophisticated equipment and skills.</p><p>Additionally, you need a tool that renders the result rapidly and is responsive. Yes, to answer briefly. One of the greatest tools we’ve seen at cramming a lot of functionality into a friendly interface is Movavi Video Editor Plus.</p><p>With that out of the way, let’s start!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/movavi-video-editor-plus-2022.jpg"                      alt="movavi video editor plus 2022"                ></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Nl0Z0eth1u4?si=0eecOBNfc--51AJO" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-1-Introduction-to-the-interface"><a href="#Part-1-Introduction-to-the-interface" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Introduction to the interface"></a>Part 1. Introduction to the interface</h2><p>Movavi Video Editor Plus is refreshingly simple and clearly identifies each component. When you first start using the application, a series of tooltips that describe how to utilize it appear. You may choose between the modes for Importing, Filters, Transitions, Titles, Stickers, and other things using the buttons on the left rail. Important functions like Color Adjustments, Crop and Rotate, Pan and Zoom, Stabilization, Slow Motion, and Chroma-Keying are included in the final group. If I were developing the program, I’d prioritize them above Stickers (as entertaining as they are).</p><p>Along with importing, the Import mode has sections for the standard Media bin, which contains all project content, as well as for sounds, music, sample videos, backgrounds, and effect packages.</p><p>The program’s main section structure is similar to that of most video editing programs, with a source box in the upper left corner, timeline tracks spanning the whole bottom half of the window, and a preview player in the upper right. Only the video preview panel may be docked, but you can change the other panels’ relative sizes.</p><p>You can add as many tracks as you like above the timeline, which has buttons for Split, Rotate, Crop, Color Adjustments, Clip Properties, Markers, Record Video, and Record Audio.</p><p>With the mouse wheel and the Ctrl key, you may resize the timeline and pause and resume playing of the video. While Movavi does not support the typical pro J, K, and L for playback and I and O for in and out edits, it does support several keyboard shortcuts.</p><p>Because it functions between sessions, the undo option is excellent. This implies that I can close a project and yet undo earlier decisions when I open it again. Another wonderful feature is the addition of a star to the timeline clip whenever a video or audio effect is applied. When you click it, the effect options are immediately accessible</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iOVkXoUxLf4?si=QfC18T2cb5OkiaXo" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Editing-and-correcting-clips"><a href="#Part-2-Editing-and-correcting-clips" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Editing and correcting clips"></a>Part 2. Editing and correcting clips</h2><p>You may use Adjustments, Blur, Color filters, Vignettes, and other effects in Movavi’s Filters mode. The majority of the sample audio and video that the application offers are downloaded after you click on them. You can look for any of the transitions or effects using a search box. The More Tools area is where the real fun begins (which changes to All Tools when you enter it).</p><p>The Overlays, Stabilization, Animation, Chroma-Key, and Audio tools are accessible from this page. The sole keyframe editing option in the program is on the Advanced tab of the Animation page, which is okay. It’s a benefit for the program’s goal of ease of use because keyframe editing, which enables you indicate precisely where on the timeline an effect should start and finish, is restricted to size, position, opacity, and rotation. PowerDirector or  Studio, which allow you to timing every effect and edit you apply with keyframes, are the best options for individuals who desire complete control over positions and effects.</p><p>Saturation, White Balance, Auto Contrast, and Magic Enhance are all included in the list of color modifications. On test clips, these performed admirably, with the Magic Enhance adding presence and life to the image.</p><p>Additionally, you can manually change the color parameters as seen below. You can adjust your scene’s atmosphere to seven other looks, including Drama, Thriller, Vintage, and Trip to Mars, thanks to a respectable range of available LUTs. The traditional day-for-night effect is noticeably absent (though it’s rarely fully convincing when it is).</p><p>You can use picture-in-picture effects with video clips that are overlapping on the timeline in different tracks by using the Overlay section. There are a few video collage themes included, fewer than some other tools, and you can resize and arrange the images however you choose. The compass that emerges when your inner image is horizontally or vertically centered is a positive.</p><p>You may see the results after setting the accuracy and shaking parameters in the stabilization tool. Its performance in a test clip impressed me. Even a strong tremble was eliminated, and compared to the original, the video had a more serene atmosphere overall.</p><p>Speed editing takes place in two locations. You can change the clip speed from 10% to 1,000% using the Speed slider on the Clip Properties screen. Simply slowing down the speed is what the Slow Motion option does. You can add a Freeze-Frame effect by right-clicking with the mouse on a clip in the timeline and selecting Insert Freeze Frame even if it isn’t in either of these panels. The Clip Properties window now provides the option to reverse playback.</p><p>Motion Tracking is available for text and stickers in addition to the Highlight and Conceal portion of All Tools. You start by selecting a mask, which can either be a black shape or a blurred shape. Following that, you can decide on the shape’s opacity, feathering, and outline appearance. The next step is tracking, which can be either swift, exact, or automated. In my tests, the latter wasn’t that slow, and it continued to track the tracked subject even after she passed behind a telephone pole, but not when she did so behind a vehicle. The most recent update, version 22.3, includes a new AI motion tracking option that can follow the subject even after she passes in front of a car (screenshot above) (see video below).</p><p>Although the Chroma-Key tool naturally starts with green as the key, you may utilize any background color in the photo by using a dropper. The tolerance, noise, edges, and opacity can all be changed. It functions, although not as well as some rivals. For instance, it gives you the option to key out many background colors.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-shoot-the-worlds-hustle-and-bustle-iphone-tips-for-shutter-speed-blurs/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Shoot the World's Hustle and Bustle IPhone Tips for Shutter Speed Blurs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-the-art-of-revisiting-your-private-snap-history/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved The Art of Revisiting Your Private Snap History</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-craft-precise-notes-using-mematic-software/"><u>[New] In 2024, Craft Precise Notes Using Mematic Software</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-photo-magic-weaving-text-into-your-imagery-journey-for-2024/"><u>[New] Photo Magic Weaving Text Into Your Imagery Journey for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/new-public-domain-game-music-downloads-for-2024/"><u>[New] Public Domain Game Music Downloads for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-enthralling-viewers-stream-with-success-even-if-youre-just-starting-out/"><u>[Updated] Enthralling Viewers Stream with Success, Even if You're Just Starting Out</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/ed-monitor-top-youtube-videos-select-rank-trackers-guide-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Monitor Top YouTube Videos - Select Rank Trackers Guide for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/updated-tips-for-overcoming-iphone-camera-focusing-glitches/"><u>[Updated] Tips for Overcoming iPhone Camera Focusing Glitches</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/complete-tutorial-to-turn-gif-to-stickers-discordwhatsapptelegram-for-2024/"><u>Complete Tutorial to Turn GIF to Stickers [Discord/WhatsApp/Telegram] for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/ending-automatic-video-captures-in-qt-player/"><u>Ending Automatic Video Captures in QT Player</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/from-cyberspace-to-steps-top-tier-treadmill-innovations/"><u>From Cyberspace to Steps Top-Tier Treadmill Innovations</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techidaily.com/how-do-i-reset-my-honor-magic-5-pro-phone-without-technical-knowledge-drfone-by-drfone-reset-android-reset-android/"><u>How do I reset my Honor Magic 5 Pro Phone without technical knowledge? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/in-2024-basics-of-visual-storytelling/"><u>In 2024, Basics of Visual Storytelling</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/in-2024-superior-imaging-why-hdr-sets-the-standard-over-sdr/"><u>In 2024, Superior Imaging Why HDR Sets the Standard Over SDR</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/seeing-more-than-ever-samsungs-galaxy-s8-and-4k-breakthrough/"><u>Seeing More Than Ever Samsung's Galaxy S8 and 4K Breakthrough</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

However, pulling off a successful live stream is quite challenging. You will have to get your script correct at the go, there are audio problems, and network issues are not ruled out. Where it all gets messed up is that you can’t edit if you make mistakes or an issue can slightly disrupt your stream. So, you have to be extra careful to do it successfully.</p><p>Fortunately, with the OneStream live streaming tool, you may not need to worry much because you can successfully and efficiently live stream a pre-recorded video. So, after recording your video and editing it to your taste, you can use OneStream to stream it as a live video to any social platform.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RvR5PNhspKE?si=uJcMYK9v-_Xq7fAg" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-OneStream-Live"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-OneStream-Live" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

Key features of OneStream Live</h2><p><strong>Multi-streaming to different social platforms:</strong> You can use it to live to stream your recorded videos or real-time stream to over 40 social media at the same time. It also supports multi-stream real-time live in combination with popular live streaming tools like Zoom, OBS, Wirecast, etc.</p><p><strong>Embed Player:</strong> with OneStream, you can live stream on your external website. You have to embed your live stream on your website.</p><p><strong>Live Spaces:</strong> if you don’t have a webpage, you don’t need to worry because OneStream has covered you.

How to live stream with Online OneStream"></a>Part 3. How to live stream with Online OneStream</h2><p>Live streaming with OneStream is pretty straightforward. I will walk you through a series of steps you can follow to live stream using OneStream successfully.</p><p>Step1 First, head to <a class="link"   href="https://app.onestream.live/signup" >OneStream live website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and create an account. Just input a username, password, and email address. After that, you need to choose a plan. OneStream offers 4 plans, as I have mentioned above. Just go through the plan features and choose the one that best suits you.</p><p>Step2 After you have successfully picked a plan, on the dashboard, you will see 40 top social platforms, and you will be requested to add your social accounts. If you can’t see the social platform you want to live stream to, you can use custom RTMP to stream it. Except for Instagram, you can connect all of your social accounts directly.</p><p>To connect your Instagram account, you must utilize a third-party software called Instafeed. Instead, it will construct your Instagram account’s Sync URL. Once the URL is generated, please copy and paste it into the OneStream Sync URL section. It will successfully connect your Instagram account to OneStream.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/live-stream-with-onestream-1.jpg"                      alt="connect onstream to your social accounts"                ></p><p>Step3 To schedule your live stream on the dashboard, click the “three-line” button.

The selected ones will get a blue ticked circle at the bottom.</li><li>Choose one and tap on “Done” to save the images.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/save.png"                      alt="save burst photo"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O7ChChlyX2o?si=7pMKdN1NZig1kYek" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part3-The-best-scenarios-to-take-burst-photos"><a href="#Part3-The-best-scenarios-to-take-burst-photos" class="headerlink" title="Part3: The best scenarios to take burst photos"></a>Part3: The best scenarios to take burst photos</h2><h3 id="1-Action-and-sports"><a href="#1-Action-and-sports" class="headerlink" title="1. Action and sports"></a>1. Action and sports</h3><p> When we hear about action and sports, the terms like speed, energy, and momentum usually start hovering over our minds. Since sports arouse excitement to a great degree, it would be interesting to take those running, skating or cycling moments using iPhone camera burst mode. Using this way of burst mode, you will be having no idea when you will get the chance of getting that ideal and flawless photo. How would it look when you are running and reached at the highest pace and the same moment will be recorded perfectly with burst feature? Wouldn’t it be interesting?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/sports.jpg"                      alt="sports"                ></p><h3 id="2-Shoot-the-best-portraits"><a href="#2-Shoot-the-best-portraits" class="headerlink" title="2. Shoot the best portraits"></a>2. Shoot the best portraits</h3><p> The iPhone photo burst will fit best when you need to shoot the excellent portraits. Keeping in mind that portrait shots are not a cake walk. The subject can be shy or not static at times or the facial expressions and poses can be weird sometimes. In such case, shooting with continuous shots will be the best option to get a stress free accomplishment of the task. The burst phot will provide more natural and candid appearance to the portrait.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/kids.jpg"                      alt="kids"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9sk53d1bBhY?si=yaTeDogLb3D4dYu1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-Take-crystal-water-and-waves"><a href="#3-Take-crystal-water-and-waves" class="headerlink" title="3. Take crystal water and waves"></a>3. Take crystal water and waves</h3><p> Another fascinating scenario to make use of burst mode is when you are under water or swimming. The waves and crystal water will look amazingly captivating when captured in your iPhone camera’s burst mode. Also, those bubbles in the water and the crystal clear look inside the water will enhance the picture quality. Therefore, an interesting idea to use burst photography is when you are in your swimming mode.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/water.jpg"                      alt="water"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oP8grXxuy2o?si=uIRNhTYbecTcaC7J" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-Take-something-valuable-moment"><a href="#4-Take-something-valuable-moment" class="headerlink" title="4. Take something valuable moment"></a>4. Take something valuable moment</h3><p> We encounter many unexpected moments in our daily life such as a bunch of birds flying together in the sky, baby crawling and nothing can be as special as when baby smiles. These unpredictable instants are so pleasant and what’s going to happen at the next moment is clueless to us. When burst mode is there, the possibility to capture these subjects increases.

You can’t actually turn off the burst mode camera which is quite disappointing for the users. Therefore, be attentive while taking a selfie or any other photo as holding capture button beyond the expected time will unknowingly capture 20-30 images.</p><h2 id="Final-Verdict"><a href="#Final-Verdict" class="headerlink" title="Final Verdict"></a>Final Verdict</h2><p> That was all about burst photography and recording the best moment possible. iPhone has always made its impression for its exceptional features and stands out at all times. With its burst mode, one can fulfill their wish to catch the most excellent candid pose which normal photography can’t. Be it, moving leaves due to winds, water splashing or rainy view, the burst mode can help under any scenario. Although iPhone offers this burst image feature and no doubt it’s excellent, but if you are looking for professional photography, this will be not worthy enough. We would recommend you to switch to the motion camera to capture those professional shots.</p><p> We hope you had fun reading this article and took as much benefit as possible from it.

With compact goggles you will be getting a lightweight goggle that should fit snuggles to your head and give you two small screens. While with the Box goggles you will have a large LCD screen (allowing for a better view,) however, they tend to be a little more heavy than the compact FPV goggles.</p><p><strong>Aspect Ratio:</strong> Your drone’s FPV camera come in one of two aspect ratios - 16:9 or 4:3. This means it is absolutely crucial to make sure that you grab a paid of FPV goggles that match that aspect ratio. If you mix and match aspect ratios yo will end up with an image that is squashed or stretched out. While you may think you could get used to the skewed view, it takes away from the precision (and point) of having a FPV goggle when drone racing.</p><p><strong>Field of View:</strong> Each set of FPV goggles comes with their own Field of View (FOV.) This means each pair of goggles has its own degree to which the edge of the viewing screen is angled from your eyes. The higher the FOV a goggle has the better your picture quality will be.</p><p><strong>Head Tracking:</strong> When it comes to drone racing, you will want to make sure you have a FPV goggle that has a high head tracking ratio. Head tracking allows for a truly immersive experience because it relates to the ability of your on-board camera motion to bind with your head motion (meaning the camera moves smoothly and accurately in relation to how you move your head as the pilot.)</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8dH3yHH9IX8?si=geiW5KbIljSFT9pz" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-essential-guide-for-newbies-visual-fidelity-in-videos/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Essential Guide for Newbies Visual Fidelity in Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-stepwise-strategies-for-high-quality-time-lapse-videos-in-gopro-studio/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Stepwise Strategies for High Quality Time Lapse Videos in GoPro Studio</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-optimizing-footage-variety-in-your-video-production/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Optimizing Footage Variety in Your Video Production</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-highest-quality-capture-options/"><u>[Updated] Highest Quality Capture Options</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-premium-home-cinema-picks-for-best-3d-blu-ray-systems/"><u>[Updated] Premium Home Cinema Picks for Best 3D Blu-Ray Systems</u></a></li><li><a href="https://common-error.techidaily.com/chrome-not-responding-heres-how-to-relaunch-and-continue-seamlessly/"><u>Chrome Not Responding?
