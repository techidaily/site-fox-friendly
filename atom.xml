Now, both on your phone and computer, you can effortlessly book, join, manage, and personalize Zoom in Gmail straight from Gmail and Google Calendar. An add-on for Gmail and Calendar has been released as a result of a collaboration between Zoom and Google. Users of Google Calendar have the option of utilizing Google Meet, the company’s own online meeting tool. Although many people prefer Zoom, that is excellent. For Google Calendar and Zoom to work together effectively, all you need to do is download and install a free app. Here, we’ll go through how to plan meetings using Gmail and Calendar with the Zoom add-on.</p><p>Having a built-in option for scheduling Zoom in Gmail meetings is crucial for individuals who often conduct business through video-based meetings. There are a few methods to link Zoom with Google Calendar if you use both services. With only one click thanks to this connection, you can include a Zoom meeting in a calendar invitation. The default choice for meetings is Google’s video conferencing service, Google Meet. This does not preclude you from using Zoom. To make it similarly frictionless, all you have to do is install a free app. By installing an add-on from the Google Workspace Marketplace, you may quickly do this operation if you use Zoom as your video-conference platform and utilize Google Calendar. When your Zoom meeting times are shown in the Google Calendar app, it is quite convenient. After that, you may get reminders and invite others. How to incorporate Zoom in Gmail is covered in this article. This is how you integrate Zoom with Google Calendar.</p><ol><li><a href="#part3-1">Calendar Link Addition</a></li><li><a href="#part3-2">Make a Video Recording of the Call</a></li><li><a href="#part3-3">Create Meeting Template</a></li></ol><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-Install-Zoom-Add-On-for-Google-Account"><a href="#Part-1-Install-Zoom-Add-On-for-Google-Account" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Install Zoom Add-On for Google Account"></a>Part 1. Install Zoom Add-On for Google Account</h2><p>Using the “Zoom for Gmail” add-on, which connects your Gmail account with Zoom, you may activate Zoom meetings on Gmail. The default choice for meetings is Google’s video conferencing service, Google Meet. To make it similarly frictionless, all you have to do is install a free app. When you include a Zoom meeting in your calendar invitation, all participants may join the meeting by simply clicking the meeting’s details and then clicking again. With this add-on, you may use Gmail’s web client’s collaboration capabilities to initiate and plan Zoom sessions. Visit the Google Workspace store to add Zoom to your G-suite account. How to install this on your account is provided here. You may achieve this by doing the actions listed below:</p><p><strong>Steps to Install Zoom for Gmail</strong></p><p>The procedures for installing the Zoom for G Suite plugin are as follows:</p><h5 id="Step1Visit-the-Google-Workplace-Marketplace"><a href="#Step1Visit-the-Google-Workplace-Marketplace" class="headerlink" title="Step1Visit the Google Workplace Marketplace"></a>Step1Visit the Google Workplace Marketplace</h5><p>Install the Zoom for Gmail add-on via the G Suite Marketplace as your first step. Click Install, continue, and then Allow to get started (when giving Zoom access to your Google account).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/zoom-for-gmail.jpg"                      alt="zoom for gmail"                ></p><h5 id="Step2Press-“Install”"><a href="#Step2Press-“Install”" class="headerlink" title="Step2Press “Install”"></a>Step2Press “Install”</h5><p>There is no need to log into Zoom or look through emails to get access. Both choices may be used for free. You can quickly book, join, and manage Zoom meetings from the mobile or desktop versions of your personal Gmail and Google Calendar by using the Zoom for G-Suite add-on. You’ll get a popup on your screen stating “Zoom for Gmail has been installed” when the installation is complete.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/install-zoom-for-gmail.jpg"                      alt="install zoom for gmail"                ></p><h5 id="Step3Log-into-your-own-Google-Account"><a href="#Step3Log-into-your-own-Google-Account" class="headerlink" title="Step3Log into your own Google Account"></a>Step3Log into your own Google Account</h5><p>Launch your web browser and open Gmail. A new Zoom icon with the text “Zoom for Gmail was installed” will appear on the right sidebar. Log into your Zoom account when the new tab has opened, then select Authorize to provide Gmail access.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/choose-account-to-continue-zoom.jpg"                      alt="choose account to continue zoom"                ></p><h5 id="Step4Press-“Allow”"><a href="#Step4Press-“Allow”" class="headerlink" title="Step4Press “Allow”"></a>Step4Press “Allow”</h5><p>You will need your account administrator’s prior consent if your Gmail account is a part of a G-suite account. You may provide Gmail access by selecting the “Request pre-approve” button after checking in with your Zoom account.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/allow-zoom-meetings-google-account.jpg"                      alt="allow zoom meetings google account"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-start-a-meeting-from-Zoom-for-Gmail"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-start-a-meeting-from-Zoom-for-Gmail" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to start a meeting from Zoom for Gmail"></a>Part 2. How to start a meeting from Zoom for Gmail</h2><p>G Suite and Zoom may be integrated in both ways. Therefore, each meeting you schedule on Zoom will have an invite link that is instantly posted to your Google Calendar. Install it after logging out of all other Google accounts and signing into the one you wish to add it to. Another feature of the Zoom for Gmail add-on is the ability to book a Zoom conference directly from Gmail. The meeting subject will automatically be pulled from the email subject line into the Google Calendar event. Simply login into Gmail in your browser and start a new email message to begin organizing Zoom meetings. Here’s how to set up a Zoom meeting on your Google Calendar and invite participants:</p><p><strong>Steps to Use Zoom for Gmail</strong></p><p>Step1 Install the “Zoom for G-Suite” plugin, that is free, from the official G-Suite store after logging into your Google account.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/install-zoom-for-gsuite.jpg"                      alt="install zoom for gsuite"                ></p><p>To get install rights if you are using an enterprise account, get in touch with your IT administrator. A lot of rights, including complete access to your whole contact list, are also required by the add-on. Skip this technique and look at Method 2, which does not need the add-on, if that makes you uncomfortable.</p><p>Step2 Now open Google Calendar, and on the right side of the window, locate the Zoom symbol. To log into your Zoom account using the add-on, click the icon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/zoom-in-google-calendar.jpg"                      alt="zoom in google calendar"                ></p><p>Step3 Turn on “Pre-approve” and adhere to the on-screen instructions to provide the app access to your Google account information.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/enable-pre-approve.jpg"                      alt="enable pre approve"                ></p><p>Step4 Next, check for the “Add Conferencing” box when creating a new Google Calendar event. Then, pick “Zoom Meeting” from the list of possibilities by clicking on the drop-down menu. At the bottom, click “Preserve” to save your selection.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/add-conference-google-calendar.jpg"                      alt="add conference google calendar"                ></p><p>Step5 The Meeting ID, password, and passcode will now be automatically filled in by the add-on in the Calendar event. Additionally, it will provide a link with joining instructions, which should be helpful for anyone who are unfamiliar with Zoom. You may now invite people to the meeting by clicking on the freshly created event in Google Calendar and using the “Add Guests” section. Finally, choose the “envelope” symbol to send guests an email invitation.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/add-guests-zoom-meeting.jpg"                      alt="add guests zoom meeting"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Tips-to-Use-Zoom-for-Gmail"><a href="#Part-3-Tips-to-Use-Zoom-for-Gmail" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Tips to Use Zoom for Gmail"></a>Part 3. Tips to Use Zoom for Gmail</h2><p>Two of the most popular productivity tools are Zoom and G Suite, which are utilized by both businesses and individuals. Users can simply book Zoom meetings from inside Google Calendar and invite friends, family, and coworkers to participate thanks to the connectivity between the two.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118305/7443" target="_top" id="2118305">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118305" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118305/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Calendar-Link-Addition"><a href="#Calendar-Link-Addition" class="headerlink" title="Calendar Link Addition"></a>Calendar Link Addition</h3><p>Without the add-on, you may still include a link to a Zoom meeting in a Google Calendar event. Because the add-on requests a ton of permissions, including full access to your complete contact list, it is really the most private alternative. Keep in mind, too, that using the manual way will not sync your meetings between Zoom and Calendar for you. If you’re okay with that, the following instructions will show you how to add a Zoom invite link to Google Calendar without the add-on:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/calendar-link-addition-meeting.jpg"                      alt="calendar link addition meeting"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115951/19272" target="_top" id="2115951">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115951" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115951/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><ul><li>Create a new meeting by using the Zoom client on your PC (or Android or iOS phone). Then, on the Meetings page, select the “Copy Invitation” option.</li><li>Open a web browser and log in to Google. After that, enter Google Calendar and manually paste the meeting details into the “Notes” area at the bottom before adding the Zoom invite link. Finally, choose “Save.” As previously mentioned, you may now use the email link to add guests and send invitations.</li><li>After accepting the invitation, the participants will see the meeting link in their Google Calendar and be able to join by clicking the link or the “Join Zoom Meeting” option.</li></ul><h3 id="Make-a-Video-Recording-of-the-Call"><a href="#Make-a-Video-Recording-of-the-Call" class="headerlink" title="Make a Video Recording of the Call"></a>Make a Video Recording of the Call</h3><p>Zoom’s web conferencing call recording as video capability is useful for sharing the conference with individuals who may have missed it or for evaluating the conversation. You must choose either the local or cloud option while recording. Local refers to storing the video file on your own devices, such as your computer or an external storage device.</p><p>Use the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> screen recorder for the much simpler experience. With the help of the Filmora screen recorder, users may simultaneously record their screen and camera as well as the audio from their system and microphone. It is possible to preserve any material on Filmora. Screen recording is the best approach to save any pleasure on your monitor. The reach may be captured together with web-based real-time recordings, video chats, and much more using screen recording and video editing tools. You may capture anything on your screen and store it.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/make-recording-of-zoom-call.jpg"                      alt="make recording of zoom call"                ></p><h3 id="Create-Meeting-Template"><a href="#Create-Meeting-Template" class="headerlink" title="Create Meeting Template"></a>Create Meeting Template</h3><p>With one URL and preserved settings, create recurring meetings. You may set up a recurring meeting with Zoom for weekly meetings, monthly check-ins, and other regularly scheduled calls. The use of this option has two advantages. First of all, you may set all the call preferences you’d like once and have them remain in effect each time you meet. Second, because repeating calls utilize the same join URL each time, you never need to provide attendees with a new one.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/create-zoom-meeting-template.jpg"                      alt="create zoo mmeeting template"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983472">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983472.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983472">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983472.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983472%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983472/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>In a nutshell, so that everyone can arrive on time, you would be able to easily choose “Zoom Meeting” inside your Google Calendar event and create a link to join it. When you include a Zoom meeting in your calendar invitation, all participants may join the meeting by simply clicking the meeting’s details and then clicking again. There is no need to log into Zoom or look through emails to get access. In addition to providing capabilities that let you fully manage the screen recording process, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is also video editing software that enables you to edit your recordings anyway you see fit.

The duration of your video will also grow if viewers keep returning to a certain piece of it.</p><p>Here’s the guide to adding a timestamp to a YouTube comment or description:</p><ol><li>Select the time you want to link to</li><li>Pause the video and note the time</li><li>Write the time in the comment</li><li>Post your comment</li></ol><p>The process is simple - just write the time you want to redirect viewers to in the comment. The timestamp format is hours:minutes:seconds (no spaces).

In the battle of podcast vs. YouTube, which one would you pick? One or both? You may upload videos on YouTube or create podcasts.</p><p>One reason to use Spotify for podcasts is that it’s a global platform, meaning your podcast can be heard by a large audience worldwide.</p><p>Spotify is a popular platform, so listeners will likely discover your podcast through them. Putting out a video on YouTube is more work than creating a podcast; however, it may be rewarding. Read and find which one is the best!</p><h2 id="A-Brief-Overview-of-Podcast-vs-YouTube"><a href="#A-Brief-Overview-of-Podcast-vs-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="A Brief Overview of Podcast vs. YouTube"></a>A Brief Overview of Podcast vs. YouTube</h2><p>There’s no denying that YouTube is one of the most popular online platforms. Millions of people use it daily to watch videos on everything from current events to how-to guides.</p><p>But YouTube isn’t the only game in town regarding online video.</p><p>Podcasts are also becoming increasingly popular, especially among people who commute or have long car journeys. So, which is better - YouTube or podcasts?</p><p>There’s a massive range of content available on YouTube. No matter your interests, you’re sure to find something to watch. YouTube videos are usually shorter than podcasts, so they’re perfect for busy people who don’t have time to commit to an extended episode.</p><p>You can watch YouTube videos on your phone or tablet, even if you’re not connected to the internet. So it is perfect for when you’re on the go. Now talking about podcasts, they can be downloaded and listened to offline, so you can listen even if you’re not connected to the internet.</p><p>The difference between podcasts and YouTube is that Podcasts are usually longer than YouTube videos. So they can be great for getting in-depth information on a topic. In addition, you may listen to podcasts while doing other things, such as driving or cooking.</p><p>Lately, investing your time in creating a meaningful video podcast makes more sense. The editing process of a podcast will be simpler than editing a YouTube video.

However, they both have their unique benefits and drawbacks. Here’s a quick rundown of the critical differences between podcasts and YouTube.</p><p>You’ll need a steady internet connection and time to watch a YouTube video. Podcasts are more convenient to listen to while doing other things, such as commuting or working out.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/podcast-vs-youtube-1.jpg"                      alt="funny kids videos on youtube can get millions of views"                ></p><p>On the downside, podcasts generally don’t have the same production value as YouTube videos, so they can sometimes feel “cheap” or “amateurish.” On the other hand, YouTube videos usually have better production value than podcasts due to content creators’ higher level of investment.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/podcast-vs-youtube-2.jpg"                      alt="apple has launched podcasts in competition with spotify"                ></p><p>YouTube also offers a more diverse range of content than podcasts since anyone can upload a video. However, YouTube videos can be much more explanatory than podcasts, making them less convenient to consume.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/podcast-vs-youtube-3.jpg"                      alt="writing a good description with tags will help get views"                ></p><h2 id="Can-You-Transform-a-Podcast-Into-a-YouTube-Video-or-Vice-Versa"><a href="#Can-You-Transform-a-Podcast-Into-a-YouTube-Video-or-Vice-Versa" class="headerlink" title="Can You Transform a Podcast Into a YouTube Video or Vice Versa?"></a>Can You Transform a Podcast Into a YouTube Video or Vice Versa?</h2><p>Many love podcasts. They have the convenience of being able to create and listen to podcasts on the go. And there are also a lot of people who love YouTube videos. They love the visuals and the ability to watch their favorite videos whenever possible.</p><p>So, what if you could combine these two? Can you transform a podcast into a YouTube video or vice versa? It turns out you can! There are a few different options, so you don’t have to choose between a podcast or YouTube.</p><p>If you have a podcast that you want to turn into a YouTube video, one option is to record the audio from the podcast and turn it into a video file. You can then upload this video to YouTube and share it.</p><p>Another option is to use screen capture software to record your podcast as you’re playing it. This will give you a video of the audio and any visuals that may be part of the show. You can then upload this video to YouTube and share it.</p><p>If you have a YouTube video that you want to turn into a podcast, one option is to download the audio from the video and transform it into an MP3 file. You can then share this MP3 file with your favorite podcasting platform.</p><p>Another option is to use screen capture software to record the video as you’re playing it. This will give you an audio file of the video and any visuals that may be part of the show. You can then upload this audio file to your favorite podcasting platform and share it with the world.</p><p>Lastly, you may present a podcast on your webcam and record the video and audio for YouTube. Meanwhile, use the audio to upload as a podcast. Then, your listeners and viewers can watch the video and listen to the podcast on the go.</p><p>And if you have a podcast that’s doing well, you can create a YouTube video series based on it. Alternatively, if you have a popular YouTube channel, you can create a podcast based on your videos.</p><h2 id="What-Are-the-Pros-Cons-of-a-YouTube-Channel-and-Podcast-Episode"><a href="#What-Are-the-Pros-Cons-of-a-YouTube-Channel-and-Podcast-Episode" class="headerlink" title="What Are the Pros &amp; Cons of a YouTube Channel and Podcast Episode"></a>What Are the Pros &amp; Cons of a YouTube Channel and Podcast Episode</h2><p><strong>Pros and Cons of a YouTube video:</strong></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>No physical office is required.

That depends on your personal preferences. If you’d like to create in-depth, topic-focused content, podcasts are probably a better choice.</p><p>If you prefer to create playful and exciting content, then vlogs might be more your thing. Ultimately, it’s up to you to decide which format you prefer. You may start with the easier one and learn how to create both podcasts and YouTube videos simultaneously.</p><p>What Is the Difference Between Podcasts and YouTube?</p><p>Podcasts and YouTube are popular audio&#x2F;video platforms for uploading and consuming content. However, they both have their unique benefits and drawbacks. Here’s a quick rundown of the critical differences between podcasts and YouTube.</p><p>You’ll need a steady internet connection and time to watch a YouTube video. Podcasts are more convenient to listen to while doing other things, such as commuting or working out.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/podcast-vs-youtube-1.jpg"                      alt="funny kids videos on youtube can get millions of views"                ></p><p>On the downside, podcasts generally don’t have the same production value as YouTube videos, so they can sometimes feel “cheap” or “amateurish.” On the other hand, YouTube videos usually have better production value than podcasts due to content creators’ higher level of investment.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/podcast-vs-youtube-2.jpg"                      alt="apple has launched podcasts in competition with spotify"                ></p><p>YouTube also offers a more diverse range of content than podcasts since anyone can upload a video. However, YouTube videos can be much more explanatory than podcasts, making them less convenient to consume.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/podcast-vs-youtube-3.jpg"                      alt="writing a good description with tags will help get views"                ></p><h2 id="Can-You-Transform-a-Podcast-Into-a-YouTube-Video-or-Vice-Versa-1"><a href="#Can-You-Transform-a-Podcast-Into-a-YouTube-Video-or-Vice-Versa-1" class="headerlink" title="Can You Transform a Podcast Into a YouTube Video or Vice Versa?"></a>Can You Transform a Podcast Into a YouTube Video or Vice Versa?</h2><p>Many love podcasts. They have the convenience of being able to create and listen to podcasts on the go. And there are also a lot of people who love YouTube videos. They love the visuals and the ability to watch their favorite videos whenever possible.</p><p>So, what if you could combine these two? Can you transform a podcast into a YouTube video or vice versa? It turns out you can! There are a few different options, so you don’t have to choose between a podcast or YouTube.</p><p>If you have a podcast that you want to turn into a YouTube video, one option is to record the audio from the podcast and turn it into a video file. You can then upload this video to YouTube and share it.</p><p>Another option is to use screen capture software to record your podcast as you’re playing it. This will give you a video of the audio and any visuals that may be part of the show. You can then upload this video to YouTube and share it.</p><p>If you have a YouTube video that you want to turn into a podcast, one option is to download the audio from the video and transform it into an MP3 file. You can then share this MP3 file with your favorite podcasting platform.</p><p>Another option is to use screen capture software to record the video as you’re playing it. This will give you an audio file of the video and any visuals that may be part of the show. You can then upload this audio file to your favorite podcasting platform and share it with the world.</p><p>Lastly, you may present a podcast on your webcam and record the video and audio for YouTube. Meanwhile, use the audio to upload as a podcast. Then, your listeners and viewers can watch the video and listen to the podcast on the go.</p><p>And if you have a podcast that’s doing well, you can create a YouTube video series based on it. Alternatively, if you have a popular YouTube channel, you can create a podcast based on your videos.</p><h2 id="What-Are-the-Pros-Cons-of-a-YouTube-Channel-and-Podcast-Episode-1"><a href="#What-Are-the-Pros-Cons-of-a-YouTube-Channel-and-Podcast-Episode-1" class="headerlink" title="What Are the Pros &amp; Cons of a YouTube Channel and Podcast Episode"></a>What Are the Pros &amp; Cons of a YouTube Channel and Podcast Episode</h2><p><strong>Pros and Cons of a YouTube video:</strong></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>No physical office is required.

Because VR is still relatively new it may not even be something that you have experienced yet. In this article we will explain what VR technology is and the types of applications it can have for the future.</p><p> <strong><em>You may also like:</em></strong><br><em><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Use Android Phones in Watching VR or 360 Videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></em><br><em><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >A Brief History of Virtual Reality <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></em><br><em><a class="link"   href="https://filmora.wondershare.com/virtual-reality/virtual-reality-technology-current-state-and-future-challenges.html" >Virtual Reality Technology: Current State and Future Challenges <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></em></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="What-is-Virtual-Reality"><a href="#What-is-Virtual-Reality" class="headerlink" title="What is Virtual Reality?"></a>What is Virtual Reality?</h2><p> Virtual Reality can be considered an extremely immersive experience that you can enjoy safely and simulate something real. By using a <a class="link"   href="https://filmora.wondershare.com/virtual-reality/what-is-vr-headset.html" >Virtual Reality headset <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or applicable application, you can enter into special simulations. These simulations are designed to be extremely immersive experiences which the user can interact with and explore. The viewer controls the environment and has the power to look around at any scene as well as potentially interact with the objects in the scene.</p><p> Virtual Reality usually take place in computer-generated simulations in which an entire 3-D environment is rendered in the closest thing to a simulation. A person can then use a variety of electronic equipment to interact with the scene and control the environment.</p><p> Overall, virtual reality means creating a simulation of a real world experience that a person can enter and leave at any time using technology. As VR continues to develop, we will only see these simulations getting more in-depth and real. The technology also continues to miniaturize and grow cheaper, bringing VR to a position where almost anyone could have the chance to try it.</p><h2 id="How-does-VR-work"><a href="#How-does-VR-work" class="headerlink" title="How does VR work?"></a>How does VR work?</h2><p> The basis of a really good VR experience however comes with a headset.</p><p><strong>A VR headset</strong> is a head-mounted display (HMD) that blocks out the outside world and displays a 3-D world or stitched images to create a simulation for the user. VR headsets block out the outside world and present a whole new view for the user. In many cases the screen is set to focus to fill our entire peripheral vision and to block out the outside world. When you put on a professional series VR headset, you should feel like you are in the scene and interacting with it.</p><p><strong>The process of starting up a VR simulation begins with putting on this headset.</strong> Users will usually start up the application or have someone get the game or application going on a PC or console. The VR headset is then plugged in and the user can switch their view over to the headset to immerse themselves in the experience. Once the headset is placed on the user’s head and adjusted to fill their peripheral vision, they can use the motion controls to control the experience on screen or their own body movement to move around the scene. As the user looks around, motion controls in the headset will control the scene as it pans across the screen. As long as the user keeps the headset on, the scene will continue to move and interact with them as they move their head or use the controllers to look around and interact.</p><p> VR technology continues to improve with immersion as well. New headsets, such as the Oculus Rift, Samsung Gear VR system are available for use in almost anyone’s home. The Oculus Rift is heralded as one of the premier systems for home use and the Samsung Gear VR works with the latest Samsung Galaxy smart phones to turn any smart phone screen into a VR experience. As more competitors continue to develop products it will be interesting to see just how the market evolves and the types of products that are available to users in the near future.</p><h2 id="The-main-features-of-VR-systems-include"><a href="#The-main-features-of-VR-systems-include" class="headerlink" title="The main features of VR systems include"></a>The main features of VR systems include</h2><ul><li><strong>Immersion</strong></li></ul><p> The goal of any VR system is to completely immerse the user in a new simulation environment. This means filling their peripheral vision using the visor, introducing sound canceling surroundsound headphones which can put them into the scene and giving them control over the scene with their head movements. At the very least introducing these three levels of control can create an immersive experience. Adding in new interaction features can be even more powerful.</p><ul><li><strong>Interaction</strong></li></ul><p> In many films and games, app creators are working at creating more immersive experiences. Using a specialty controller in the new Playstation VR for example can help users to interact with the scene and control elements. Having the ability to pick up objects in the scene or even interact with characters can improve immersion even further and add to the value of VR simulations.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Benjamin Arango</p><p>Benjamin Arango is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Benjamin Arango</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-androids-ultimate-guide-to-photo-editors-is-pickup-a-contender/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Android’s Ultimate Guide to Photo Editors Is PickUp a Contender?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-the-symphony-of-silence-breakers-crafting-your-own-custom-alerts-and-sounds-on-android/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved The Symphony of Silence Breakers Crafting Your Own Custom Alerts & Sounds on Android</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-transform-your-fb-vids-to-full-screen/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Transform Your FB Vids to Full Screen</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/new-blitz-30-second-guide-to-fast-thumbnails-for-2024/"><u>[New] Blitz 30-Second Guide to Fast Thumbnails for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/n-2024-insightful-rank-watchers-optimizing-your-video-performance/"><u>[New] In 2024, Insightful Rank Watchers Optimizing Your Video Performance</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-pinnacle-photo-narrative-assembly-platform/"><u>[New] In 2024, Pinnacle Photo Narrative Assembly Platform</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-cost-outline-for-composing-sounds-to-screen-titles-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Cost Outline for Composing Sounds to Screen-Titles for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-the-art-of-capturing-imagination-best-shot-tips/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, The Art of Capturing Imagination Best Shot Tips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-reviving-your-stream-tackling-facebook-live-glitches/"><u>[Updated] Reviving Your Stream Tackling Facebook Live Glitches</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-ultimate-tutorial-from-webp-to-jpeg-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Ultimate Tutorial From WebP to JPEG for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-able.techidaily.com/battlefield-5-ultimate-guide-to-fixing-your-frame-rate-and-lag-problems/"><u>Battlefield 5: Ultimate Guide to Fixing Your Frame Rate and Lag Problems</u></a></li><li><a href="https://hardware-help.techidaily.com/1722974078070-easy-access-to-up-to-date-kodak-printer-drivers-download-now/"><u>Easy Access to Up-to-Date Kodak Printer Drivers – Download Now</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/head-to-head-comparison-apple-tv-4k-stacks-up-to-roku-ultra/"><u>Head-to-Head Comparison: Apple TV 4K Stacks Up to Roku Ultra</u></a></li><li><a href="https://apple-account.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-reset-the-security-questions-of-your-apple-id-on-your-apple-iphone-xs-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, How To Reset the Security Questions of Your Apple ID On Your Apple iPhone XS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/in-2024-unlocking-asmrs-wellness-boost-for-you/"><u>In 2024, Unlocking ASMR's Wellness Boost for You</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/ultimate-list-timely-humor-for-various-gatherings-for-2024/"><u>Ultimate List Timely Humor for Various Gatherings for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/c/5597632/2129043/19576" target="_top" id="2129043">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19576-2129043" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/i/5597632/2129043/19576"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->]]></content>

Retailers are initiating this virtual reality experienced by using focus groups to take customers on various shop along experiences. These shop along experiences involve the use of a guide where the shoppers are all going around and experiencing the same store at the same time. Through this focus group testing retailers are fine-tuning what makes a good online store and a good VR experience for retail shopping.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="The-Development-of-VR-shopping"><a href="#The-Development-of-VR-shopping" class="headerlink" title="The Development of VR shopping"></a>The Development of VR shopping</h2><p> Although VR shopping is still very much in its infancy, this could become one of the more popular ways to shop online. With the rising VR devices as well as the data that retailers are gathering through VR shopping experiences, the process is mutually beneficial. The annual revenue for headsets and VR devices is set to grow over the course of 2016 considerably. Many technology theorists have also speculated that the annual revenue generated by VR devices should grow to 30 billion by the year of 2020. This is a huge boost from a market that is currently sitting at less than $1 billion per year in investment.</p><p> For the future of buying clothing online, retailers could have a huge advantage. Never before has there been a system in which a 3D rendering of a fashion item is created for users to view from every side. This type of individual shopping experience could lead to more satisfied customers as well as an ability to showcase detailed fashion items with their 3D rendered online counterparts. As work is completed in VR tech and user integration, there could eventually come a day where users can eventually start trying on their clothing in virtual-reality online. This would help with a number of issues of fit and function with online clothing retailers.</p><h2 id="The-application-use-scenarios-of-VR-shopping"><a href="#The-application-use-scenarios-of-VR-shopping" class="headerlink" title="The application use scenarios of VR shopping"></a>The application use scenarios of VR shopping</h2><p> In its current form there are a number of big scenarios where VR shopping can deliver a huge advantage over a traditional online shopping experience:</p><ul><li><strong>Presenting the brand</strong></li></ul><p> The full branding for a company would be in place from the marketing signs, music, image of the store and more. A VR experience gives a retailer more flexibility for creating an experience that’s unique and on brand without having to spend countless dollars improving a physical space. Updating brand marketing can be done with simple patches for cost savings.</p><ul><li><strong>Buying large investment items</strong></li></ul><p> Customers can inspect items like furniture and clothing from every potential angle ensuring it is to their specifications reducing the cost of returns and improving satisfaction.</p><ul><li><strong>Trying on Clothes&#x2F;Makeup</strong></li></ul><p> Customers can have real ideas of what an item will look like and if it will fit a 3-D rendering of their body before they purchase. Makeup simulations and clothing simulations will show customers just how items fit without having to go to a retail location to try them on.</p><p> Overall the future of VR looks very bright and with VR shopping experiences as a potential revolution that arises as part of VR, we could soon be living in a world where going to the mall means putting on a headset.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Benjamin Arango</p><p>Benjamin Arango is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Benjamin Arango</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-elevating-visuals-with-hdr-excellence-in-photoshop/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Elevating Visuals with HDR Excellence in Photoshop</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/new-navigating-through-pc-hdr-content-watch-edit-enjoy/"><u>[New] Navigating Through PC HDR Content Watch, Edit, Enjoy</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-reversing-live-action-on-twitch-a-comprehensive-guide/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Reversing Live Action on Twitch A Comprehensive Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-posts.techidaily.com/updated-a-meticulous-review-the-complete-guide-to-androids-lightroom/"><u>[Updated] A Meticulous Review The Complete Guide to Android's Lightroom</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/updated-dive-into-display-dimensions-for-video-newbies/"><u>[Updated] Dive Into Display Dimensions For Video Newbies</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blue-screen-error.techidaily.com/decode-and-debug-eliminating-blue-screen-error-code-0x00000/"><u>Decode & Debug: Eliminating Blue Screen Error Code 0X00000</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/elevate-speech-impact-accessibility-to-free-voice-modification-software-for-2024/"><u>Elevate Speech Impact Accessibility to Free Voice Modification Software for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/embracing-iphones-shutter-speed-magic-for-dynamic-images/"><u>Embracing iPhone’s Shutter Speed Magic for Dynamic Images</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/structuring-stimulating-podcast-segments-for-2024/"><u>Structuring Stimulating Podcast Segments for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/top-samsung-electronics-offers-for-prime-day-exclusive-discounts-not-to-miss/"><u>Top Samsung Electronics Offers for Prime Day: Exclusive Discounts Not to Miss</u></a></li></ul></div><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2037335/7443" target="_top" id="2037335">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2037335" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2037335/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->]]></content>

Thereafter, open Snapchat and start shooting the video. The background song from the music app will be recorded in your Snapchat video. All you have to do is time the video perfectly so that the song can sync with your video.</p><p><strong>Send Video Without Any Sound</strong> – If you want to record a short video on Snapchat and send it across to your friends without the audio part or any sound, you can do it instantly. All you need to do is record the video as usual and then tap on the Microphone icon located at the bottom-left corner.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Linguistic-Inputs-Utilize-No-Fee-Required"><a href="#Linguistic-Inputs-Utilize-No-Fee-Required" class="headerlink" title="Linguistic Inputs, Utilize No Fee Required"></a>Linguistic Inputs, Utilize No Fee Required</h2><p>It’s an obvious fact that <strong>speech recognition</strong> has been available for decades. But it was only until the emergence of AI (Artificial Intelligence) and ML (Machine Learning) technologies that this invention burst into life. Today, most smartphones and computers come baked with <strong>automatic speech recognition</strong> services. So, what exactly is voice recognition, and how can you exploit it on your smartphone or desktop? This article answers these questions. You’ll also learn how to use the best free voice recognition programs. Let’s dig in!</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Speech-Recognition"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Speech-Recognition" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Speech Recognition?"></a>Part 1: What is Speech Recognition?</h2><p>Computers and smartphones are catching up with human intelligence. Today, you can command your computer, smartphone, or smart speaker. Google Assistant, Microsoft’s Cortana, and Amazon Alexa are good examples of how far speech recognition has come. Just give a command, and the voice assistant will be at your service.</p><p>But this article will dive a little deeper than the obvious. Instead of dwelling on voice assistants, we’ll discuss how you can use an automated STT program to convert audio to text. The speech recognition technology has matured enough to allow users to enjoy 99% transcription accuracy. Also, these speech-to-text transcription programs support hundreds of languages, making them perfect for bloggers, teachers, doctors, and other professions.</p><p>But take note that the ability and complexity of these programs may vary. While some are beginner-friendly, others, like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, can be a little intimidating to beginners. Also, some TTS programs like Google Speech Recognition don’t need PC downloads, saving you time. So, it depends on your preferences and skills.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Best-Free-Speech-Recognition-Services-in-2022"><a href="#Part-2-Best-Free-Speech-Recognition-Services-in-2022" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Best Free Speech Recognition Services in 2022"></a>Part 2: Best Free Speech Recognition Services in 2022</h2><p>We understand that professional speech-to-text services can cost a few hundreds of dollars. Therefore, we’ve dug deep to bring you these four free and highly accurate speech recognition services. Make a pick!</p><ol><li><strong>Google speech recognition</strong></li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/speech-recognition-software-1.jpg"                      alt="google docs speech recognition"                ></p><p>Founded in September 1998, Google has come a long way to be one of the biggest tech companies. The company features multiple transcription services, including <a class="link"   href="https://translate.google.com/?sl=ar&tl=en&op=translate&hl=en" >Google Translate <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which translates audio, documents, and texts between various languages. It supports 133 languages and is free to use on your mobile or PC browser. Just click the microphone icon on Google Translate and begin translating words.</p><p>Besides translation, use <a class="link"   href="https://cloud.google.com/" >Google Cloud <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to transcribe video, audio, or voice to increase your audience reach. Users can add accurate captions and subtitles to their content in real-time, thanks to ML technology similar to what Google uses to generate YouTube subtitles. It’s tailored for the Global user base as it supports 125+ languages. Google Cloud also allows you to boost transcription accuracy by providing domain-specific words or keywords.</p><p>As for the pricing, Google Cloud gives you up to $300 credits to spend over three months with the free tier. After exhausting the free minutes, you can transcribe 15-second audio for just $0.006. Now that should be affordable for all average Joes out there.</p><p>If Google Cloud doesn’t impress you, transcribe audio for free with <a class="link"   href="https://www.google.com/docs/about/" >Google Docs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It’s an online service allowing you to dictate texts from the built-in microphone. To do that, start a new document, click “Tools,” and then tap “Voice typing.” Now dictate unlimited texts before editing them accordingly. Remember, Google Docs supports collaborative editing.</p><ol><li><strong>Microsoft speech recognition</strong></li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/speech-recognition-software-2.jpg"                      alt="windows speech recognition"                ></p><p>Like Google, Microsoft has a collection of speech recognition services too. First, you can use the built-in speech recognition service on your Windows 10&#x2F;11 computer. It’s a free service that gives you essential assistant and command capabilities. Please note that this is different from Cortana’s voice assistant.</p><p>To use Windows speech-to-text service, start by opening the program into which you want to dictate texts. This can be your browser, text editor, and so on. Then, click the Win + H shortcut before clicking the microphone icon to start dictating texts.</p><p>Alternatively, use the super-accurate <a class="link"   href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/speech-to-text/" >Microsoft Azure <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> speech-to-text service. This professional feature lets you create texts from a host of audio sources. It provides real-time audio transcription, thanks to the deep ML and AI networks that work in sync to support multiple audio sources concurrently. However, setting it up is a different ballgame altogether.</p><p>If Azure Speech to Text is too complicated for you, use OneNote to dictate texts while signed into Microsoft 365. This voice recognition software can dictate texts with punctuations, emojis, periods, symbols, currencies, and more. Also, you can edit texts by merely uttering words like delete, undo, backspace, etc.</p><ol><li><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><strong>Wondershare Filmora 11</strong></a></li></ol><p>Wondershare Filmora 11 is a powerful video editor for macOS and Windows systems. It packs many powerful features, including the AI-driven speech-to-text and text-to-speech converters. Here, you can transcribe audio or video in various languages before editing and extracting the text to a .srt file. So yes, it’s a fast and accurate subtitle generator for desktops.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/speech-recognition-software-3.jpg"                      alt="filmora speech recognition create project"                ></p><p>To generate subtitles with Filmora 11, run the program on your desktop and create a New Project. After that, click the Import button to browse and load a video or audio from your local storage. Of course, you can drag and drop the media file to save time. Either way, move the uploaded file to the storyboard.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/speech-recognition-software-4.jpg"                      alt="filmora speech recognition set language"                ></p><p>Next up, right-click the video and choose Detach Audio. In other words, you’ll be separating audio from the video clip. After that, select the audio track on the timeline and click the Speech-to-Text icon to choose the transcription language. You can transcribe the audio in English, French, German, Italian, and other languages.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/speech-recognition-software-5.jpg"                      alt="filmora speech recognition edit texts"                ></p><p>Now tap “Ok” to encode audio to subtitle texts. If the process is successful, double-tap the text track on the timeline to view and edit the subtitle tracks. You can change the text, layout, size, color, and more. Lastly, export the texts to an SRT file and use it on any video. It’s that quick and easy!</p><ol><li><strong>Amazon Transcribe</strong></li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/speech-recognition-software-6.jpg"                      alt="amazon speech recognition"                ></p><p>Have you ever heard of AWS? Well, it is a comprehensive cloud platform with more than 200 services. AWS uses Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, making it easier, faster, and more cost-friendly. Even better, AWS has up to 98 security standard certifications, making it one of the safest cloud platforms to create and edit content.</p><p>That said, use the <a class="link"   href="https://aws.amazon.com/transcribe/" >Amazon Transcribe <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> feature to convert audio and voices into editable texts automatically. This service lets you extract critical insights from voice calls, videos, conversations, microphone narrations; you name them. It also uses deep ML to add formatting and punctuations to your text during dictation.</p><p>AWS Transcribe also includes a few extras that you might find helpful. For example, it supports batch processing from numerous audio sources. Also, it can identify different speakers and vocabulary filtering, giving you the much-needed consistency. Plus, you can add specific vocabulary and keywords to enhance content accuracy.</p><p>Cost-wise, you’ll enjoy up to 60 minutes of free transcription services with an AWS free tier account. After depleting the credits, you can pay for the standard pay-as-you-go rates. All in all, it’s an excellent speech recognition service, although it can be an overkill for personal use.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Speech-Recognition-FAQs"><a href="#Part-3-Speech-Recognition-FAQs" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Speech Recognition FAQs"></a>Part 3: Speech Recognition FAQs</h2><p>Do you have a lot of unanswered questions about voice recognition? Here are some answers to the most common speech recognition FAQs.</p><h3 id="1-Is-dictating-texts-faster-than-typing-texts"><a href="#1-Is-dictating-texts-faster-than-typing-texts" class="headerlink" title="1. Is dictating texts faster than typing texts?"></a>1. Is dictating texts faster than typing texts?</h3><p>It depends! For people without quick typing skills, dictating audio is a no-brainer. TTS programs such as Windows Speech Recognition and Google Docs allow you to dictate texts directly into the document file before editing where necessary. However, it takes a lot of discipline and clarity to dictate texts accurately.</p><h3 id="2-How-can-I-improve-the-accuracy-of-speech-recognition"><a href="#2-How-can-I-improve-the-accuracy-of-speech-recognition" class="headerlink" title="2. How can I improve the accuracy of speech recognition?"></a>2. How can I improve the accuracy of speech recognition?</h3><p>First of all, some speech recognition services are more accurate than others. But the overall text accuracy will depend on the clarity of your voice. While the built-in mic will do fine, investing in a noise-canceling voice input device is better. You should also dictate texts with longer phrases more often. And another thing, avoid using slang and abbreviations.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://electronicx.pxf.io/c/5597632/1166360/14483" target="_top" id="1166360">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14483-1166360" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://electronicx.pxf.io/i/5597632/1166360/14483"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-Is-voice-recognition-technology-accurate"><a href="#3-Is-voice-recognition-technology-accurate" class="headerlink" title="3.

But as said before, this depends on a lot of factors. Also, it’s paramount to preview your transcription work and add the necessary corrections. Remember, human intelligence is always superior.</p><h3 id="Final-Words"><a href="#Final-Words" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h3><p>Now you know how speech recognition can be helpful in your documentation work. If you want something free and highly effective, I recommend Google Docs or Windows Speech Recognition to dictate texts on your document app. On the other hand, use <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora 11 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to auto-generate subtitles from any audio or video file.

These days, most computers have built-in webcams, so one of the easiest ways to start recording video is to use a webcam.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/best-webcam-for-podcast-1.jpg"                      alt="podcast camera"                ></p><p>Webcams are inexpensive, easy to set up, and usually already come pre-loaded with software that will allow you to record video and audio for your podcast.</p><h2 id="What-to-expect-from-a-webcam-for-podcasting"><a href="#What-to-expect-from-a-webcam-for-podcasting" class="headerlink" title="What to expect from a webcam for podcasting?"></a>What to expect from a webcam for podcasting?</h2><p>Adding video to your podcasts can help them stand out. However, just like with other forms of webcasting, there’s no guarantee that you will have the best audio quality out of the box. Here are four things you can expect from your webcam when doing a podcast:</p><h3 id="1-Field-of-view"><a href="#1-Field-of-view" class="headerlink" title="(1) Field of view"></a>(1) Field of view</h3><p>It’s essential to keep the field of view (FOV) wide enough so obstacles do not block the camera, even if those obstructions are large. On the other hand, if the FOV is too narrow, the camera may be unable to capture all of the scenery in front of it, thus missing key elements of your shot. Also, a wider FOV will produce a more dramatic picture and give your audience a better sense of the setting.</p><h3 id="2-Picture-quality"><a href="#2-Picture-quality" class="headerlink" title="(2) Picture quality"></a>(2) Picture quality</h3><p>The quality of a webcam will determine how much it can be used for video-conferencing, recording video and audio, and live-streaming events. The quality of a webcam is defined by its resolution (the higher, the better), frame rate, dynamic range, and noise levels. The resolution of a webcam is measured in pixels per inch. High-resolution webcams have 1280 x 720-pixel resolution, while lower-quality ones have 640 x 480 resolution.</p><h3 id="3-Companion-software"><a href="#3-Companion-software" class="headerlink" title="(3) Companion software"></a>(3) Companion software</h3><p>Most webcams include a companion app or downloadable software that will make them even more versatile and powerful.

These days, most computers have built-in webcams, so one of the easiest ways to start recording video is to use a webcam.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/best-webcam-for-podcast-1.jpg"                      alt="podcast camera"                ></p><p>Webcams are inexpensive, easy to set up, and usually already come pre-loaded with software that will allow you to record video and audio for your podcast.</p><h2 id="What-to-expect-from-a-webcam-for-podcasting-1"><a href="#What-to-expect-from-a-webcam-for-podcasting-1" class="headerlink" title="What to expect from a webcam for podcasting?"></a>What to expect from a webcam for podcasting?</h2><p>Adding video to your podcasts can help them stand out. However, just like with other forms of webcasting, there’s no guarantee that you will have the best audio quality out of the box. Here are four things you can expect from your webcam when doing a podcast:</p><h3 id="1-Field-of-view-1"><a href="#1-Field-of-view-1" class="headerlink" title="(1) Field of view"></a>(1) Field of view</h3><p>It’s essential to keep the field of view (FOV) wide enough so obstacles do not block the camera, even if those obstructions are large. On the other hand, if the FOV is too narrow, the camera may be unable to capture all of the scenery in front of it, thus missing key elements of your shot. Also, a wider FOV will produce a more dramatic picture and give your audience a better sense of the setting.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134223/18498" target="_top" id="2134223">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134223" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134223/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-Picture-quality-1"><a href="#2-Picture-quality-1" class="headerlink" title="(2) Picture quality"></a>(2) Picture quality</h3><p>The quality of a webcam will determine how much it can be used for video-conferencing, recording video and audio, and live-streaming events. The quality of a webcam is defined by its resolution (the higher, the better), frame rate, dynamic range, and noise levels. The resolution of a webcam is measured in pixels per inch. High-resolution webcams have 1280 x 720-pixel resolution, while lower-quality ones have 640 x 480 resolution.</p><h3 id="3-Companion-software-1"><a href="#3-Companion-software-1" class="headerlink" title="(3) Companion software"></a>(3) Companion software</h3><p>Most webcams include a companion app or downloadable software that will make them even more versatile and powerful.

You might have seen numerous <strong>Canon time-lapse</strong>s and always wanted to create one.</p><p>If you want to take the challenge and create something magical like this with your Canon camera, you have come to the right place. Here we will tell you everything from how to shoot to editing time-lapse videos. You will also get some tips for time-lapse recording video so let’s start with this article.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Time-lapse-Video"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Time-lapse-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What is Time-lapse Video?"></a>Part 1. What is Time-lapse Video?</h2><p>Time-lapse video is considered a technique of cinematography where a photographer takes a series of images in the same frame at several intervals for a certain period and rapidly plays it for the entire time. For instance:- Separate shots of a flower blooming over time becomes a video of growing a flower from seedling to bloom.</p><p>So what’s the purpose of it? Here is the purpose of creating an illusion of extreme speed movement by manipulating the time. It seems like the object is rushing at a fast pace. This cinematography technique is mainly used for capturing prolonged processes that will become exciting and visible if it is watched with the human eye.</p><p>The time-lapse is even used to capture swift movement, showing it faster. This article will explore how time-lapse on canon 6d is made. In simple words, time-lapse is a process of shooting for an extended period and then editing in fast motion to make it enjoyable. Let’s see how it is done.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Shoot-Time-lapse-Video-with-Canon-Camera"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Shoot-Time-lapse-Video-with-Canon-Camera" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to Shoot Time-lapse Video with Canon Camera?"></a>Part 2. How to Shoot Time-lapse Video with Canon Camera?</h2><p>Let’s explore the time-lapse world in the comfort of your home or when you are chilling out with your family and friends. You can use your Canon 70d time-lapse to do it better. The time-lapse is an innovative technique that allows you to reveal a hidden world on the move, and it will produce some magical and surprising results. Let’s check out the steps of hooting time-lapse video with a Canon camera.</p><p><strong>1:-</strong> Change your Canon camera settings to the Time-lapse movie by tapping on the menu and searching Timelapse Movie mode in your menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/enable-time-lapse-canon-camera.jpg"                      alt="enable time lapse on canon"                ></p><p><strong>2:-</strong> Tap on the info button to access the setting for the interval time and the no. of shots.</p><p><strong>3:-</strong> You can choose the interval number to determine your camera’s frequency, which means once every second or twice a minute. The interval time will depend on the subject. Recording a slow-moving object like blossoming flowers or drifting clouds will take more time between the shots and vice versa.</p><p><strong>4:-</strong> Put the number of shots you want your camera to take. According to the interval and number of shots, your Canon 80d time-lapse will tell you the number of footage you have to take to end the video. There is a general thumb rule for recording time-lapse videos, and you will need around 24-25 images for each second of your video.</p><p><strong>5:-</strong> Compose the shot and tap on the shutter button. While shooting the time-lapse video, it is recommended that you should place the camera on a tripod to maintain the composition of duration. Also, after you are happy with the composition and settings, you can tap the shutter button and allow your camera to show its magic.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Canon-Time-Lapse-Video-Shooting-Tips"><a href="#Part-3-Canon-Time-Lapse-Video-Shooting-Tips" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Canon Time Lapse Video Shooting Tips"></a>Part 3. Canon Time Lapse Video Shooting Tips</h2><p><strong>Never forget to take test shots:-</strong> You must never start shooting straight away. Also, you can take some random test shots. This ensures you get the best composition and angle you are looking for.</p><p><strong>Always take photos in JPG:-</strong> Set the Canon Camera to capture pictures in the best JPG quality, or else you can run out of space quickly.</p><p><strong>Use manual mode:-</strong> It’s recommended to shoot in manual mode, and you must shoot with the manual white balance, exposure, aperture, and shutter speed. Moreover, it will help you to avoid auto-adjusting your camera.</p><p><strong>Carry extra batteries:-</strong> If you want to create a time-lapse video outdoors, you must carry extra batteries. Also, it is good if the camera battery is changed before your camera gets shut down. If you are shooting time-lapse video indoors, it’s better to use the main charger. Also, it will help you avoid excess battery draining.</p><p><strong>Carry Extra Memory cards:-</strong> You will never want to run out of space while making a time-lapse, and you will have to make the calculations according to your time-lapse. Also, make sure you carry the extra memory cards to be prepared.</p><p><strong>Choose the best spot:-</strong> Set your tripod securely and in a place where it cannot be knocked or moved quickly.</p><p><strong>Focus on the camera:-</strong> Always ensure that the equipment and camera are in sight while you are shooting and safe.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Extra-How-to-Edit-Timelapse-Video-on-Computer"><a href="#Part-4-Extra-How-to-Edit-Timelapse-Video-on-Computer" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.
