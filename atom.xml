What is new about the past couple of years’ experience regarding buzzwords in their profusion? That is thanks to the COVID 19 pandemic which rather contrary to common-sense expectations acted as a catalyst to processes that were either yet to be hatched or were lying dormant. The world of tech has been at the forefront of such unfolding and hence words like Artificial Intelligence, Distributed Cloud, Hyper Automation, Metaverse, Everything as a service (XaaS), Quantum Computing, Cybersecurity Mesh, and many, many more have gained wide currency rather quickly. So let us begin at the beginning by understanding what it is that we talk about when we are talking about Metaverse nowadays.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/metaverse-device.jpg"                      alt="Metaverse Device"                ></p><p>Source: thenextweb.com</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">What Is Metaverse Technology?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">Must-Have Metaverse Devices You Should Know</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">Eye on the Future: Where Will Metaverse Go?</a></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Metaverse-Technology"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Metaverse-Technology" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is Metaverse Technology?"></a>Part 1: What Is Metaverse Technology?</h2><p>The word Metaverse might be a hot topic today but it has been around for quite a significant amount of time now. In his 1992 sci-fi novel “Snow Crash”, author Neal Stephenson coined the term first. The word referred to the author’s projection of a world that is a 3D simulation per excellence populated by lifelike virtual avatars. The world has moved on since 1992 and so the idea of Metaverse has undergone further developments as well.

Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, voiced his support for the Metaverse when, while declaring the rebranding, he said, “The next platform and medium will be a much more immersive and embodied internet where you’re in the experience, not just looking at it, and we call this the metaverse.” Meta has delivered on this by unveiling the Horizon Workrooms beta, a virtual meeting area designed for co-workers to hold their meetings using a metaverse device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/metaverse-device-meta.jpg"                      alt="metaverse device meta"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vFQCEZiYA08?si=xjIu5IAy77RlHWii" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-Microsoft"><a href="#2-Microsoft" class="headerlink" title="2.

Microsoft holograms can change someone into a digital speaker of an alien language. The Microsoft Mesh platform has since then been busy developing mixed and extended reality applications. Microsoft has also made known its intention of developing Microsoft Teams along these lines in 2022. Collaboration with the U.S. army is also underway aimed at designing an augmented reality Hololens 2 hardware that will help soldiers train better. Microsoft’s Xbox Live must be accounted for here as well as it establishes connections between millions of video gamers from around the globe. The company would also start working on the development of 3D hyper-real spaces for the world of retail and general workplaces.</p><h3 id="3-Epic-Games"><a href="#3-Epic-Games" class="headerlink" title="3.

Epic Games has made it further immersive by holding music concerts by artists like Arianna Grande, Travis Scott, unveiling movie trailers and music debuts in the metaverse. A splendid remaking of Martin Luther King Jr’s famed “I Have a Dream” speech earned it further credentials.

But whatever the path that the technology takes, it is beyond dispute that the metaverse is here to stay. And this makes it mandatory that one gets acquainted with the gears that are needed to undertake this journey.

Burning Paper"></a>1. Burning Paper</h3><p>A year without a new SpongeBob meme is nothing. In this meme, SpongeBob may be seen reading a document with some mockery before burning it without looking back. This sample only demonstrates the lack of interest some individuals have in anything.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/burning-paper.jpg"                      alt="burning paper"                ></p><h3 id="2-They-Can’t-Read"><a href="#2-They-Can’t-Read" class="headerlink" title="2.

Using this template, you may express a strong or unpopular stance while simultaneously making snide remarks about others who disagree with you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/they-cant-read.jpg"                      alt="they cant read"                ></p><h3 id="3-I-Am-Once-Again-Asking"><a href="#3-I-Am-Once-Again-Asking" class="headerlink" title="3.

This example only demonstrates the fact that certain choices aren’t worthwhile at any price.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/draw-25.jpg"                      alt="draw 25"                ></p><h3 id="5-I-Pretend-I-Do-Not-See-It"><a href="#5-I-Pretend-I-Do-Not-See-It" class="headerlink" title="5.

There are times when we just do not want to see things, especially when they are complete and total disappointments, like the year 2020.

Most people who have made their first million by podcasting make no more than half a million dollars a year.</p><p>Consider a scenario to figure out what podcasters can expect to earn and how much they’ll need to invest in their studios and equipment. Let’s say you’re a podcaster and you have the following stats:</p><ul><li>5% of your audience buys a product through your link, earning you $20 for each.</li><li>Your 3% audience supports you on Patreon, leaving you with $7 per person per month.</li><li>1% of your audience purchases a monthly online course for $49.</li><li>You’re making about 5 podcasts per month.</li><li>And lastly, you’re placing 4 ads in every episode, spaced out throughout the episode.</li></ul><p>Considering all the statistics and more than 1,000 downloads&#x2F;listeners per episode, you could make more than $1000 per month, which is a good amount.</p><ul><li>$300&#x2F;month from affiliate sales</li><li>$210&#x2F;month from Patreon support</li><li>$490&#x2F;month from course sale</li><li><strong>Total &#x3D; $1000&#x2F;month</strong></li></ul><p>If you have 5000 download&#x2F;listeners per episode:</p><ul><li>$1500&#x2F;month from affiliate sales</li><li>$1050&#x2F;month from Patreon Support</li><li>$2450&#x2F;month from course sale</li><li><strong>Total &#x3D; $5000&#x2F;month</strong></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"                                     ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> These numbers are only speculative and assumptions.

That’s pretty much how it started for every podcaster. Yet, even though it may be easy to start a podcast, it’s not always so easy to make a living at it.</p><p>We’ll show you a bunch of ways podcasters earn a living doing something they love. Let’s take a look…</p><h3 id="Sponsorship"><a href="#Sponsorship" class="headerlink" title="Sponsorship"></a>Sponsorship</h3><p>In a podcast, a sponsor is the first thing you need to think about when seeking to make money from your podcast. With so many podcast ad networks, there are many options for advertisers wanting to advertise on podcasts. Podcasters hire networks, negotiate terms, and secure content on their behalf.</p><p>You need at least 5,000 listeners per month to be accepted by Midroll or Authentic. Suppose you don’t have a minimum number of listeners, you can always connect directly with sponsors, but your niche audience must be a perfect fit to get accepted.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-much-do-podcasters-make-2.jpg"                      alt="marketing charts"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/td3ojuzhloY?si=N_maQNiJWrJp7XZl" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Complementary-products"><a href="#Complementary-products" class="headerlink" title="Complementary products"></a>Complementary products</h3><p>As a podcaster, you are your merchant. There are some obvious items that you need to sell, such as t-shirts, caps, mugs and more.</p><p>You don’t have to sell everything; start small and grow. Promoting complementary products in your podcast is the best way to make extra income.</p><p>It’s important to know the best ways to market your brand through various platforms like, selling through a third party like eBay or Etsy that allow podcasters to sell their wares at wholesale pricing.</p><p>One thing to keep in mind when selling merchandising is that the more niche your podcast is, the less likely you will be able to sell a lot of it. Instead, focus on making quality items that appeal to your target audience.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Iz2LYWd8EqI?si=G_3CqFRAmeVPczjj" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Listeners’-donations"><a href="#Listeners’-donations" class="headerlink" title="Listeners’ donations"></a>Listeners’ donations</h3><p>If you don’t have any other income sources, consider crowdfunding and&#x2F;or donations to help you keep producing high-quality content. Crowdfunding is the act of funding a project or venture by raising funds from a large group of people.</p><p>Crowdfunding websites such as Kickstarter, GoFundMe, and Indiegogo allow people to share ideas and raise money for personal projects. You’ll need to carefully screen your donors, but if you’re willing to take some chances, the rewards can be pretty lucrative.</p><p>The downside is that, if you reach your fundraising goal, your funds may run out before you’re ready to launch your project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-much-do-podcasters-make-3.jpg"                      alt="indiegogo funds"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6KXVWj6Ar1M?si=Cd_jktmoN3e9OzH3" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Affiliate"><a href="#Affiliate" class="headerlink" title="Affiliate"></a>Affiliate</h3><p>One of the quickest ways to generate income for your podcast is to monetize it through affiliate marketing.

Let’s take a look…</p><h3 id="Sponsorship-1"><a href="#Sponsorship-1" class="headerlink" title="Sponsorship"></a>Sponsorship</h3><p>In a podcast, a sponsor is the first thing you need to think about when seeking to make money from your podcast. With so many podcast ad networks, there are many options for advertisers wanting to advertise on podcasts. Podcasters hire networks, negotiate terms, and secure content on their behalf.</p><p>You need at least 5,000 listeners per month to be accepted by Midroll or Authentic. Suppose you don’t have a minimum number of listeners, you can always connect directly with sponsors, but your niche audience must be a perfect fit to get accepted.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-much-do-podcasters-make-2.jpg"                      alt="marketing charts"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sXLLPY11of0?si=-3YNnpnO0wbc0K_-" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Complementary-products-1"><a href="#Complementary-products-1" class="headerlink" title="Complementary products"></a>Complementary products</h3><p>As a podcaster, you are your merchant. There are some obvious items that you need to sell, such as t-shirts, caps, mugs and more.</p><p>You don’t have to sell everything; start small and grow. Promoting complementary products in your podcast is the best way to make extra income.</p><p>It’s important to know the best ways to market your brand through various platforms like, selling through a third party like eBay or Etsy that allow podcasters to sell their wares at wholesale pricing.</p><p>One thing to keep in mind when selling merchandising is that the more niche your podcast is, the less likely you will be able to sell a lot of it. Instead, focus on making quality items that appeal to your target audience.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XIUatTFH0Zw?si=ZCtoBtIy18y2F5Vc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Listeners’-donations-1"><a href="#Listeners’-donations-1" class="headerlink" title="Listeners’ donations"></a>Listeners’ donations</h3><p>If you don’t have any other income sources, consider crowdfunding and&#x2F;or donations to help you keep producing high-quality content. Crowdfunding is the act of funding a project or venture by raising funds from a large group of people.</p><p>Crowdfunding websites such as Kickstarter, GoFundMe, and Indiegogo allow people to share ideas and raise money for personal projects. You’ll need to carefully screen your donors, but if you’re willing to take some chances, the rewards can be pretty lucrative.</p><p>The downside is that, if you reach your fundraising goal, your funds may run out before you’re ready to launch your project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-much-do-podcasters-make-3.jpg"                      alt="indiegogo funds"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Nyp7-xVwqHA?si=XCuZbpKLFIdrGQQh" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Affiliate-1"><a href="#Affiliate-1" class="headerlink" title="Affiliate"></a>Affiliate</h3><p>One of the quickest ways to generate income for your podcast is to monetize it through affiliate marketing. With affiliate marketing, you make money when your audience purchases something through an affiliate link that you provide them.</p><p>You could sell a related product, share your affiliate link through social media or email, or even host a giveaway and earn a commission when someone enters their information.</p><p>In addition to the many affiliate marketing programs, some are specifically for podcasting, such as Amazon and ShareASale.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-much-do-podcasters-make-4.jpg"                      alt="amazon affiliate program commission rate"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Popular-Podcasts-Earnings-in-2024-1"><a href="#Part-4-Popular-Podcasts-Earnings-in-2024-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Popular Podcasts Earnings in 2024"></a>Part 4: Popular Podcasts Earnings in 2024</h2><p>So many people are trying to figure out the best ways to make money online.

Various image attributes such as contrast, color, saturation, detail, black level, and white point can be enhanced whether it is movies, videos, or still images.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-color-grading"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-color-grading" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What is color grading?"></a>Part 1. What is color grading?</h2><p>Color grading is the process of stylizing the color scheme of your footage by “painting” over what you’ve created using color correction. After the colorist completes the color correction, they can begin the process of grading the footage. During color grading, colorists use editing software to stylize the shot – emphasizing the visual tone and atmosphere of the film and making it look more cinematic.</p><p>Color sorting can be used for both technical and creative changes. Colorists use color gradation for artistic purposes to ensure that a film’s carefully selected color palette conveys a specific atmosphere, style, or emotion. For example, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0169547/"><em>American Beauty (1999)</em></a> uses redder in dramatic moments to represent passion, anger, and power, whereas <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1587310/"><em>Maleficent (2014)</em></a> uses green to represent danger, corruption, and darkness.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/color-grading-tutorial-1.jpg"                      alt="color grading tutorial"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/43goO8X0iX0?si=48Cqf6td2q_6T6h3" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fZTlPdOFNmo?si=Ym8p7ayV1gtNzzXj" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-11-best-Color-Correction-and-Color-Grading-Tutorial"><a href="#Part-2-11-best-Color-Correction-and-Color-Grading-Tutorial" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 11 best Color Correction and Color Grading Tutorial"></a>Part 2. 11 best Color Correction and Color Grading Tutorial</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U6lCtLUeROA?si=se6OFuis9JpcTGJf" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Color-correction-and-grading-in-Premiere-Pro-2021"><a href="#1-Color-correction-and-grading-in-Premiere-Pro-2021" class="headerlink" title="1.

Now gamers even want to experience video conferencing while playing their games. Unfortunately, there is no availability of <strong>zoom on Xbox one.</strong> Zoom is available on almost every platform and device, but for Xbox, it has some more time. It appears that Zoom won’t return to Xbox anytime soon, and competitiveness would be one of the primary causes.</p><p>Why would Microsoft let a third-party video chatting app since they already have successful ones of their own? What then seems to be in the Zoom? Players still want that on their Xbox despite the fact that it is unlikely to materialize anytime soon. Before going any further, how can I access Zoom meetings on Xbox One? Have a brief overview of Zoom’s capabilities to comprehend the pressing XBOX requirement better.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y3VlwHTQQMs?si=BXYwD1pKiaTuev4y" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-1-Is-Zoom-app-available-on-Xbox"><a href="#Part-1-Is-Zoom-app-available-on-Xbox" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

You may be late because the XBOX has Zoom Rooms in their app store, which might help the users to get zoom meetings on the Xbox. But, recently, it got removed by Xbox from the App Store, which left Xbox gamers disconnected.</p><p>But there is nothing to worry about, and you might have heard the phrase “if there is a will, there is a way.” You can also get a zoom meeting i.e. on Xbox with another option. That way is known as Screen Casting. It is a straightforward method of <strong>using zoom on Xbox one</strong>, but most ignored by many of its users. Let’s look at how you can use a screencast by using Chromecast on the Xbox.</p><ul><li>For setting up a Zoom meeting i.e. on Xbox, at first, you will have to “plug in” Chromecast that is to Xbox One’s HDMI port.</li><li>Now, opt for moving to the Xbox Pins and then find the TV app; select to launch that application.</li><li>After choosing the TV app, you will be told to connect the satellite box or cable. You can tap on the “A” button on the remote to select the option.</li><li>After a few times, the Chromecast can get detected by Xbox One, which will appear in a small window. After that, at this point, the next button will get activated and once the button gets activated, click “Next.”</li><li>If you wish to set up the Xbox One for controlling the Casting Screen, tap on “Next.” If it is not, you can click on “Skip” and move to the next screen.</li><li>In the next window, choose what you wish to do after Xbox starts. You can select “On Start, Open TV or go home after it starts. After you select the option from the drop-down, you can now opt for clicking “Next” to complete the Chromecast setup.</li><li>After successful setup, switch back to the casting device, i.e., iPhone, Android, iPad, Mac, Laptop or Desktop, etc.</li><li>Now, opt to visit settings and then opt for clicking on the Cast.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/zoom-meeting-cast.jpg"                      alt="zoom meeting cast"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FATJWpNYmio?si=72ugPTb3vJXz6cAM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><ul><li>At this point, the list of every installed device gets displayed on the device screen.</li><li>Now, opt for choosing Xbox One by choosing the gaming console name for casting the device’s screen on Xbox One.</li><li>You can now launch Zoom meetings or rooms on the device, which can then be cast directly to the Xbox One.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-yZKNLxj3po?si=-RbF6nCJEVlHWP-M" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-Setup-Zoom-Conference-on-Xbox"><a href="#Part-3-Setup-Zoom-Conference-on-Xbox" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

This application helps people in their meetings, business meetings, or group meetings. Here are the steps to help you set up a zoom conference on Xbox.</p><ul><li>At first, opt for downloading the Zoom rooms to Android devices, PC, MAC, iPhones, and iPad to get started.</li><li>After the installation is done, you can open “The zoom app.” The zoom rooms are also available on the Xbox.</li><li>For linking your Xbox and device, opt for clicking on the option “Connect.”</li><li>Then, start your meeting by simply clicking on “Meet Now.”</li></ul><p>Furthermore, it is pretty similar to screencasting Zoom on Xbox.
