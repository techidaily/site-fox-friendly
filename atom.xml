Before you scratch your head to baldness, all these platforms allow you to upload and view videos on-demand. However, the technology that supports this function is much deeper. From the time you shoot your video until you share it with the world, it has undergone several post-production procedures, including compression using the AV1 codec.</p><p>The following is everything you need to know about the AV1 codec. As you keep reading, you will learn about the history of codec AV1, why it is popular, and its application in your video post-production. In addition, you will discover the best video editors to use when working with AV1 format videos. So let your journey to video editing supremacy begin.</p><ol><li><a href="#part1-1">What is a codec, and what is the AV01 codec</a></li><li><a href="#part1-2">Is it popular</a></li><li><a href="#part1-3">Where is AV1 codec used</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part2">What are the best video editors to edit an AV1 format video</a></li></ul><ol><li><a href="#part2-1">Avidemux</a>  </li><li><a href="#part2-2">Lightworks</a>  </li><li><a href="#part2-3">Filmora Video Editor</a>  </li><li><a href="#part2-4">Movavi Video Editor</a>  </li><li><a href="#part2-5">VirtualDub</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part3">FAQ</a></li></ul><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part1-What-is-the-av01-codec"><a href="#Part1-What-is-the-av01-codec" class="headerlink" title="Part1: What is the av01 codec?"></a>Part1: What is the av01 codec?</h2><p>Initially, companies relied on proprietary technology to provide you with video content. For example, most video providers were using variants of MPEG codecs to edit their online content, with others preferring  for 4K content. However, using this method proved expensive and meant that some companies were missing out on the lucrative video streaming market.</p><p>As such, the Alliance for Open Media was formed in 2015 to develop an open-source, royalty-free video codec to outperform all previous versions. Through this collaboration, the Aomedia Video 1 (AV1) codec came to be. Here are some questions to help you understand the technology much better.</p><h3 id="What-is-a-codec-and-what-is-the-AV01-codec"><a href="#What-is-a-codec-and-what-is-the-AV01-codec" class="headerlink" title="What is a codec, and what is the AV01 codec?"></a>What is a codec, and what is the AV01 codec?</h3><p>A codec is a type of compression technology that consists of two parts:</p><ul><li>An encoder compresses the original file to smaller sizes that you can share through the internet or other portable storage.</li><li>A decoder to decompress the file to its original format.</li></ul><p>In addition, you can use different types of codecs depending on the file format. For example, MPEG codecs were the preferred choice for video files. However, streaming companies now use codec AV1 for their content. This is because it offers faster compression times and smaller files than other previous video codecs.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1886019/19272" target="_top" id="1886019">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1886019" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1886019/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Is-it-popular"><a href="#Is-it-popular" class="headerlink" title="Is it popular?"></a>Is it popular?</h3><p>Yes, it is. Since its introduction in May 2018, more companies have been integrating the codec in their offerings. Here is a list of companies that offer AV1 codec support:</p><ul><li>Google offers AV1 codec support for Chrome web browser and all Android 10+ smart devices, including your mobile and smart TV.

Furthermore, the AOMedia patent license is fully compliant with the W3C Patent Policy, meaning you will not face any legal ramifications if you use the technology. As such, you will find the technology available on non-AOMedia member devices. For example, Broadcom offers AV1 codec support on its BCM 72190 and 72180 chipsets for Android TVs.</p><h2 id="Part2-What-are-the-best-video-editors-to-edit-an-AV1-format-video"><a href="#Part2-What-are-the-best-video-editors-to-edit-an-AV1-format-video" class="headerlink" title="Part2: What are the best video editors to edit an AV1 format video?"></a>Part2: What are the best video editors to edit an AV1 format video?</h2><p>Now that you know what AV1 is, what are the best video editors to edit an AV1 format video?

For example, most video providers were using variants of MPEG codecs to edit their online content, with others preferring  for 4K content. However, using this method proved expensive and meant that some companies were missing out on the lucrative video streaming market.</p><p>As such, the Alliance for Open Media was formed in 2015 to develop an open-source, royalty-free video codec to outperform all previous versions. Through this collaboration, the Aomedia Video 1 (AV1) codec came to be. Here are some questions to help you understand the technology much better.</p><h3 id="What-is-a-codec-and-what-is-the-AV01-codec-1"><a href="#What-is-a-codec-and-what-is-the-AV01-codec-1" class="headerlink" title="What is a codec, and what is the AV01 codec?"></a>What is a codec, and what is the AV01 codec?</h3><p>A codec is a type of compression technology that consists of two parts:</p><ul><li>An encoder compresses the original file to smaller sizes that you can share through the internet or other portable storage.</li><li>A decoder to decompress the file to its original format.</li></ul><p>In addition, you can use different types of codecs depending on the file format. For example, MPEG codecs were the preferred choice for video files. However, streaming companies now use codec AV1 for their content. This is because it offers faster compression times and smaller files than other previous video codecs.</p><h3 id="Is-it-popular-1"><a href="#Is-it-popular-1" class="headerlink" title="Is it popular?"></a>Is it popular?</h3><p>Yes, it is. Since its introduction in May 2018, more companies have been integrating the codec in their offerings. Here is a list of companies that offer AV1 codec support:</p><ul><li>Google offers AV1 codec support for Chrome web browser and all Android 10+ smart devices, including your mobile and smart TV. In addition, you can also video chat on Google Duo using the AV1 codec.</li><li>Microsoft also offers AV1 codec support for their Edge browser.</li><li>Other companies that offer codec AV1 support with their software include Opera, Mozilla Firefox, VLC Media Player, and Vivaldi.</li><li>Samsung and LG support 8K streaming on their Q950TS and ZX-OLED TVs, respectively.</li><li>Intel and NVIDIA also offer HD AV1 support with their graphics processing units.</li><li>Additionally, video content providers such as Amazon, Netflix, and YouTube offer AV01 codec support through their devices and online platforms.</li><li>Following successful tests in 2018, Facebook now uses the AV1 codec for videos on the platform.</li></ul><h3 id="Where-is-AV1-codec-used-1"><a href="#Where-is-AV1-codec-used-1" class="headerlink" title="Where is AV1 codec used?"></a>Where is AV1 codec used?</h3><p>The AV1 codec is offered on a license-free basis to any interested user. Furthermore, the AOMedia patent license is fully compliant with the W3C Patent Policy, meaning you will not face any legal ramifications if you use the technology. As such, you will find the technology available on non-AOMedia member devices. For example, Broadcom offers AV1 codec support on its BCM 72190 and 72180 chipsets for Android TVs.</p><h2 id="Part2-What-are-the-best-video-editors-to-edit-an-AV1-format-video-1"><a href="#Part2-What-are-the-best-video-editors-to-edit-an-AV1-format-video-1" class="headerlink" title="Part2: What are the best video editors to edit an AV1 format video?"></a>Part2: What are the best video editors to edit an AV1 format video?</h2><p>Now that you know what AV1 is, what are the best video editors to edit an AV1 format video?

The following tips will help you take your iPhone photography to a new level.</p><h4 id="1-Become-a-Master-of-Light"><a href="#1-Become-a-Master-of-Light" class="headerlink" title="1.  Become a Master of Light"></a>1.  Become a Master of Light</h4><p> Photography is the art of writing with light, as a matter of fact, the way you use light in a photo will determine how good it is. The trouble is, that each scene you shoot is going to have different light values, which means that you’ll have to adjust the iPhone camera settings each time you decide to take a photo on a new location.</p><p><strong>How to Avoid Sources of Light in a Shot:</strong> The first and most basic rule of photography is to try to avoid having sources of light in your shot, and the best way to achieve this is to turn your back to the light source and have the subject of the photo positioned in the direction from which the light is coming from. If you do this, taking pictures that depict stark contrast of shadows and light will become much easier.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/take-use-shadows-in-photography.jpg"                      alt="take-use-shadows-in-photography"                ></p><p> Image resource: Contrastly</p><p><strong>How to Take a Silhouette Photo:</strong> If you want to take a silhouette photo, simply place the subject of a photo between the light source and your iPhone camera. The source of light in the background will direct too much light into your camera, which will force you to reduce the exposure of a photo, thus the subject of the photo will become underexposed or a mere silhouette.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/get-silhoutte-photo.jpg"                      alt="get-silhoutte-photo"                ></p><p> Image resource: YouTube</p><p><strong>How to Take Advantage of Natural Light:</strong> The best periods during the day for photography are the sunrise and the sunset because the light provided by the sun is the softest. Portrait and numerous other genres of photography benefit from soft, diffused light. The colors in your pictures will appear much warmer and the results you’ll be able to get will be much more visually pleasing than on photos on which you used direct lightning.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/golden-hour-photo.jpg"                      alt="golden-hour-photo"                ></p><p> Image resource: Contrastly</p><h4 id="2-Learn-How-To-Compose-Your-Photos-and-Videos"><a href="#2-Learn-How-To-Compose-Your-Photos-and-Videos" class="headerlink" title="2.

Some of the most basic principles of picture composition include the rule of thirds or the diagonal method of arranging objects on a photo.</p><p><strong>How to Use the Grid feature:</strong> The Grid feature on iPhone camera app can help you master the rule of thirds because it will divide your screen into nine equal rectangles, so you can use each rectangle to improve the organization of the elements within a shot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/grid-mode-iphone.jpg"                      alt="grid-mode-iphone"                ></p><p> Image resource: Macworld</p><p><strong>How to Use the Diagonal Method of Image Composition:</strong> Using the diagonal method of photo composition is also a fairly simple task, since you just need to follow a diagonal of the frame, and you can use this method on horizontally and vertically oriented images.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/diagonal-photography.jpg"                      alt="diagonal-photography"                ></p><p> Image resource: PictureCorrect</p><p><strong>How to Use Symetry on a Photo:</strong> Symmetry is often used for the depiction of reflections because this method of photo composition enables you to show the real object or a scene and its reflections in equal measure. Symmetric photos are more pleasing to the human eye than asymmetric images, which is the reason why pictures that use symmetry as the guiding compositional principal have a better chance of being recognized as good or beautiful.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/symetry-photography.jpg"                      alt="symetry-photography"                ></p><p> Image resource: PictureCorrect</p><h4 id="3-Use-Different-Camera-Angles-to-Depict-a-Scene"><a href="#3-Use-Different-Camera-Angles-to-Depict-a-Scene" class="headerlink" title="3.  Use Different Camera Angles to Depict a Scene"></a>3.  Use Different Camera Angles to Depict a Scene</h4><p><strong>How to Use 180-degree Rule:</strong> When approaching a new scene, even a simple scene such as a selfie, try to visualize a straight line at the height of your eye level between the iPhone camera you are holding and the subject of the photo. The so-called 180-degree rule suggests that you shouldn’t ever cross that imaginary line, but each degree between 0 and 180 degrees can be an angle from which you take the shot.</p><p><strong>How to Use Low-Angle Shots:</strong> Every camera position that goes above this line is called the bird’s eye view, and each camera position below this line is called a low-angle shot. Placing the camera below the level of your eyesight can be quite beneficial for the photo’s aesthetic qualities because it will offer a unique view of the scene to the viewer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/low-angle-shot-photography.jpg"                      alt="low-angle-shot-photography"                ></p><p> Image resource: Storyboard Class</p><p> Exploring different camera angles will enable you to show the scene from different points of view and it will allow you to ‘solve’ the scene in a more efficient way. Assuming that the best angle for a certain scene is at our eye level is natural, but trying to depict a scene from different points of view usually results in better pictures.</p><h4 id="4-Accentuate-Depth-in-Your-Images"><a href="#4-Accentuate-Depth-in-Your-Images" class="headerlink" title="4.  Accentuate Depth in Your Images"></a>4.  Accentuate Depth in Your Images</h4><p><strong>How to Separate the Foreground From the Background:</strong> The illusion of depth in a photo makes the picture look more realistic, and it also creates a visual dynamics between the foreground and the background of an image. There are a number of techniques you can use to accentuate depth on your photos or in your videos. The most common trick is to move the subject of your photo into the background and have the elements in the foreground lead the spectator to the subject.</p><p> <strong>How to Use Shallow Depth of Field:</strong> Alternatively, you can place the subject of a photo in the foreground, thus creating a considerable amount of separation between the two picture planes. The blurry background surrounding the razor-sharp foreground creates an illusion of depth that captivates the viewer’s attention. In order to achieve this you need to create a shallow depth of field, which may not be an easy task when using an iPhone camera, fortunately, there are a lot of apps at the App Store that can be used to highlight the illusion of depth in a photo.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/separate-the-foreground-from-background.jpg"                      alt="separate-the-foreground-from-background"                ></p><p> Image resource: Makeuseof</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AIMmjowaFs4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/Y5UmwDaI7HU/s250-c-k/photo.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Liza Brown</p><p>Liza Brown is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Liza Brown</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-engineer-meme-creation-in-adobe/"><u>[New] Engineer Meme Creation in Adobe</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-streamline-your-multimedia-browsing-in-chrome-using-pip/"><u>[New] In 2024, Streamline Your Multimedia Browsing in Chrome Using PIP</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-ultimate-routes-turning-pinterest-vids-into-music-files/"><u>[New] In 2024, Ultimate Routes Turning Pinterest Vids Into Music Files</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-unlock-pubgs-hidden-voice-tweaks-quickly/"><u>[New] In 2024, Unlock PUBG's Hidden Voice Tweaks Quickly</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/new-sprint-to-quicker-vimeo-streams/"><u>[New] Sprint to Quicker Vimeo Streams</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-viewpoint-validation-digest/"><u>[New] Viewpoint Validation Digest</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-asmr-quality-high-standards-meet-affordable-costs/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved ASMR Quality High Standards Meet Affordable Costs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-brilliance-at-a-click-choosing-5-pioneering-apps-for-video/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Brilliance at a Click Choosing 5 Pioneering Apps for Video</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/updated-beat-your-song-into-success-with-fb-top-vids-guide/"><u>[Updated] Beat Your Song Into Success with FB Top Vids Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-unveiling-the-secrets-of-youtube-to-mp4mpeg-mastery/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Unveiling the Secrets of YouTube to MP4/MPEG Mastery</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-excellent.techidaily.com/1-step-by-step-guide-performing-a-complete-ipad-data-backup-offline-and-using-itunes/"><u>1.

When editing video, there is a transition between every edit or cut. The easiest audio transitions in Premiere Pro are when you switch directly from one scene to the next. This enables a seamless changeover between scenes for the editor. To tie the scenes together and make the change from one scene to the next seem seamless, it usually happens gradually. The transition that seasoned videographers utilize most often is this one.</p><p>A scene or speech transition in which the audio gradually (or abruptly) lowers in volume are known as an audio fade out. If you want to know about how to crossfade audio in premiere pro, then we’ve got you covered. It is a common sort of transition that may be used to soften a transition between two clips or to smooth out a cut. However, switching between clips without any extra special effects might sometimes seem difficult to viewers. Follow the steps below to cross fade audio in Premiere Pro.</p><ol><li><a href="#part1-1">Constant Gain</a></li><li><a href="#part1-2">Constant Power</a></li><li><a href="#part1-3">Exponential Fade</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part2">How to Crossfade Audio in Premiere Pro</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Alternative way to add audio transitions in videos</a></li></ul><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-Types-of-Audio-Transitions-in-Premiere-Pro"><a href="#Part-1-Types-of-Audio-Transitions-in-Premiere-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Types of Audio Transitions in Premiere Pro"></a>Part 1. Types of Audio Transitions in Premiere Pro</h2><p>Let’s briefly take a look at the most popular audio transitions in Premiere Pro before going through the step-by-step tutorial on making an audio fade out. The audio fade is essentially a visual transition. Crossfading describes the audible transition between two audio samples on the same track. The terms “fade-in” and “fade-out” refer to the two different kinds of crossfade transitions, and Premiere Pro offers its customers three different crossfade effects: constant gain, constant power, and exponential fade. Following are some specifics:</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2049369/7443" target="_top" id="2049369">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2049369" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2049369/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Constant-Gain"><a href="#Constant-Gain" class="headerlink" title="Constant Gain"></a>Constant Gain</h3><p>When switching between scenes, audio is constantly increased or decreased. The audio frequently sounds abrupt during this crossfade. Constant gain crossfade is a kind of audio transition where the audio is consistently increased or decreased as you switch between clips. Additionally, it lacks the exponential fade’s smoothness. Don’t ignore it however; it does have its uses.

Types of Audio Transitions in Premiere Pro"></a>Part 1. Types of Audio Transitions in Premiere Pro</h2><p>Let’s briefly take a look at the most popular audio transitions in Premiere Pro before going through the step-by-step tutorial on making an audio fade out. The audio fade is essentially a visual transition. Crossfading describes the audible transition between two audio samples on the same track. The terms “fade-in” and “fade-out” refer to the two different kinds of crossfade transitions, and Premiere Pro offers its customers three different crossfade effects: constant gain, constant power, and exponential fade. Following are some specifics:</p><h3 id="Constant-Gain-1"><a href="#Constant-Gain-1" class="headerlink" title="Constant Gain"></a>Constant Gain</h3><p>When switching between scenes, audio is constantly increased or decreased. The audio frequently sounds abrupt during this crossfade. Constant gain crossfade is a kind of audio transition where the audio is consistently increased or decreased as you switch between clips. Additionally, it lacks the exponential fade’s smoothness. Don’t ignore it however; it does have its uses. You’ll probably use this sparingly.</p><h3 id="Constant-Power-1"><a href="#Constant-Power-1" class="headerlink" title="Constant Power"></a>Constant Power</h3><p>In Premiere, the fade that dilutes the audio volume fluctuations between clips is represented by Constant Power. The second clip begins with a rapid spike and then decelerates at the conclusion of the transition. It produces a fluid, cinematic sequence that is understated yet high in quality. ideal for your next movie.</p><p>It is used to gradually reduce audio for the first clip at start, then swiftly when the transition comes to a close. It works by gradually speeding up at the conclusion of the transition before gradually reducing the audio for your initial clip. This crossfades raises audio in the second clip swiftly at initially and then more gradually at the conclusion of the transition.</p><h3 id="Exponential-Fade-1"><a href="#Exponential-Fade-1" class="headerlink" title="Exponential Fade"></a>Exponential Fade</h3><p>This crossfade operates in an exponential manner, beginning slowly before accelerating till the conclusion of the clip, giving the impression of a moving curve. An audio transition known as an exponential fade begins off slowly before gradually lowering or raising the level until it is finished. It works well for sequences with dialogue switches or for the conclusion. Without the abrupt flip, it provides a considerably shorter fade out that ends fast yet gracefully.

The Sony Xperia XZ Premium comes with a front camera of 13MP and a back camera of 19MP. One of the best things about their camera is that it is one of the very few that allows you to take a photo like if you were using a real camera. Overall speaking, the Sony Xperia XZ Premium camera is quite easy to use and it does offer a good experience. However, what we notice is that there are some things that don’t even make sense. One of them is the fact that although they include the 4K technology and this is a top feature that only the best smartphones have, the 4K appears as a special mode just like the creative effects or the AR. Their camera has an amazing feature that we loved: it is able to record slo-mo video at only 980 frames per second. With this kind of camera, you can even film a nature documentary because it will catch all the details. However, we also need to tell you this up-front: you do need a good light.</p><p> <strong>Related:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Sony Xperia XZ Premium 4K Smartphone Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="2-Huawei-P10"><a href="#2-Huawei-P10" class="headerlink" title="2.

And now, you can take advantage of their amazing cameras. The Huawei P10 comes with one front camera with 8Mp and two back cameras: one with 12MP and another one with 20MP. Just like it already happened with the previous Huawei models, you can use the 20MP one to take black-and-white photos. However, when you use both rear cameras, your photos will have a better clarity. Although the Huawei P10 comes with the feature that allows you to shoot 4K videos, the fact is that it doesn’t offer any <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >stabilization <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> when you’re recording at this resolution. As if this wasn’t enough, if you use Windows, you won’t be able to open them by using Windows’s 10 Photos app, VLC, and you won’t even be able to upload it directly to YouTube. Another thing that we notice is that the Huawei P10 camera doesn’t deal very well with low light. Even though you’ll have fun playing with the different modes of the Huawei P10 camera, the truth is that there are better smartphone cameras in the market these days.</p><p><strong>Related:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Huawei P10 Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="3-Samsung-Galaxy-S8"><a href="#3-Samsung-Galaxy-S8" class="headerlink" title="3.

So, we weren’t really expecting anything less than that. The Samsung Galaxy S8 comes with a front camera with 8Mp and a rear camera with 12Mp. In what concerns to the menu itself, although you will only see the main icons on the screen, they included a lot of features that you can use. The Samsung Galaxy S8 camera works very well in the outdoors. The photos are sharp and show a lot of details and textures. And one of the main reasons why they achieve this major success is because their camera is using the HDR as default. Plus, since they also include the electronic stabilization, this ensures that your photos will be great even though you shake or the light is a bit low. In case you’re serious about shooting 4K videos, you need to know that the sound quality is not the best in the market and that you might have a few problems with the hybrid stabilization system. However, the Samsung Galaxy S8 camera still is one of the best in the market.</p><p><strong>Related:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Samsung Galaxy S8 4K Smartphone Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="4-Google-Pixel-XL"><a href="#4-Google-Pixel-XL" class="headerlink" title="4.

The Google Pixel XL includes a front camera with 8Mp and a rear camera with 12.3Mp. Although you might find some excessive sharpness on some of your photos, most people seem to like it. One of the things that allow the Google Pixel XL to remain as one of the best on the market until today is the fact that the smartphone features the Snapdragon 821. And since it is so powerful, the Google Pixel XL is able to run HDR+ all the time. If there is something we love about the Google Pixel XL camera is the ability it has to combine different “raw” images and produce a high-quality JPG without any ghosting or blurring. In the 4K videos, you can count with some pretty smooth and nice videos although it doesn’t include optical stabilization. The difference is that Google chose to use gyro-based stabilization instead. The Google Pixel XL camera also works pretty well not only with low light photos as well as selfies that come with a lot of detail.</p><h4 id="5-LG-G6"><a href="#5-LG-G6" class="headerlink" title="5.

Plus, you can shoot 4K videos with the one that you choose. One of the best things about the LG G6 is the fact that it is water-proof. So, if you like outdoor activities, you can take some photos or shoot videos in the rain or around the pool. However, the LG G6 isn’t easy to mount and it’s not rugged, making it a bit difficult to use when compared with other smartphones on the market. Overall, the camera of the LG G6 isn’t that good. Although you can take pretty good photos in bright light and the phase detection autofocus is pretty accurate and quick, you won’t have any depth effect. So, you’ll always see some kind of blurring in the background. In case you decide to use the wider lens, you should expect to see some kind of distortion. However, what we really don’t like is the lack of detail on the photos. However, if you decide to take a photo in a low light environment, the quality of the images is quite remarkable. Although you’ll still see some noise, they are quite good. In what concerns to 4K videos, we can only say they are ok. Although the audio is great, there is no stabilization on the LG G6. So, if you’re shooting something that is moving quickly you won’t even get an ok 4K video.</p><h4 id="6-OnePlus-5"><a href="#6-OnePlus-5" class="headerlink" title="6. OnePlus 5"></a>6.

When you’re taking photos in a low light, they will be incredibly detailed and sharp. Even though the OnePlus 5 doesn’t have any stabilization, as long as you’re taking a photo to a non-moving subject and you keep your hands steady, you can expect great results. Even though the lack of stabilization doesn’t affect photos very much, the truth is that affects the quality of your 4K videos a lot. This is, indeed, one of the main weaknesses of the OnePlus 5. In what concerns the front camera, the OnePlus 5 features one of the highest resolutions we have seen so far on the market. So, if you’re planning to take out many selfies, you can be sure the OnePlus 5 is perfect for you. One of the things we most like about the OnePlus 5 camera is their app interface. It’s simple, intuitive, and easy to use. You can play with all the settings you want with ease. The only drawback is really the video.</p><h4 id="7-HTC-U11"><a href="#7-HTC-U11" class="headerlink" title="7. HTC U11"></a>7.

And in what comes to this, the HTC U11 is definitely the winner. Featuring a front camera with 16Mp and a rear camera with 12Mp, the HTC U11 is perfect if you like to take “normal” photos. Since it includes the “dual-pixel” feature (just like the Samsung S8) that allows you to quickly focus, you can view them in every screen size that they will look amazing. In what concerns to video, although the default is set to 1080p, you can easily select the 4K option. One of the good things is that the HTC U11 includes image stabilization; one bad thing is that it doesn’t really work well when you’re using the 4K resolution (it works best when you’re using the default resolution - 1080p). Overall, the HTC U11 doesn’t disappoint at all. Yes, it could be better, especially in what concerns with 4K video shooting. However, the photos you get, especially with low light, are pretty amazing.</p><h4 id="8-Xiaomi-Mi6"><a href="#8-Xiaomi-Mi6" class="headerlink" title="8. Xiaomi Mi6"></a>8.

It’s about half of most of the smartphones featured on this list and their features aren’t half for sure. Many people tend to say that the Xiaomi Mi 6 is the replica of the iPhone 7 Plus. Well, you can say that considering the cameras that are identical on both phones. Just like the iPhone 7 Plus, the Xiaomi Mi 6 comes with an 8Mp front camera and a dual rear camera with 12Mp each. The one camera that doesn’t have anything to do with iPhone’s camera is the front one. It does, indeed have some different features. You can use a configurable tilt-shift mode, for example, that will make things look just like miniature models. In what concerns with the rear cameras, the Xiaomi Mi 6 does a great job with photos where there is good light. They are pretty sharp and very detailed. However, one of the things that should come as standard is the HDR. You will need to activate it when you want to use it which is not that good. Plus, it seems the hardware of the Xiaomi Mi 6 doesn0t have the ability to work with such a mode often since the app might crash. Both the depth effect and the zoom lens seem to work pretty well when there is a good light. If there was one thing that really surprised us was the quality of the photos with low lightning. It actually resembles the HTC U11 which is a great compliment. However, when it comes to video, regretfully, the Xiaomi Mi 6 fails completely. The Xiaomi Mi 6 doesn’t have any stabilization and the footage isn’t detailed or crisp. Plus, the sound isn’t good as well. Summing all up, even though the Xiaomi Mi 6 may be great taking great photos either with bright and low lights, the fact is that you shouldn’t consider it if you’re planning on shooting 4K videos.</p><h4 id="9-iPhone-7-Plus"><a href="#9-iPhone-7-Plus" class="headerlink" title="9. iPhone 7 Plus"></a>9. iPhone 7 Plus</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-7-plus-4k-smartphone.jpg"                      alt="iPhone 7 Plus 4K Phone"                ></p><p>Featuring a 7Mp camera in the front and 2 back cameras, both with 12Mp, the iPhone 7 Plus was the first Apple smartphone to include 2 cameras in the back. The only feature added to the camera of the iPhone 7 Plus is the telephoto lens. This feature allows you to have a 2x optical zoom and it works pretty well. However, rather than that, the features continue to be all the same that was already included on the previous versions of the iPhone. One of the things that we really don’t like is the fact that the video resolution settings aren’t where they were supposed to be. Instead, you need to open the Setting’s app of the smartphone and scroll until you find the Photos &amp; Camera. Other than this, we are quite happy with the iPhone experience. The main camera photos are absolutely great in terms of color accuracy, sharpness, focus, and contrast. After all, it enables the HDR by default and it works pretty quickly. In what concerns to 4K videos, we are happy to say that they are detailed and sharp, just like the photos we already mentioned. The audio is high-quality and the stabilization is impressive. But not all is good with the iPhone 7 Plus camera. Low light photos may show you a low-quality level, especially when compared with these top smartphones. They will look very noisy.</p><h4 id="10-MOTO-Z2-Play"><a href="#10-MOTO-Z2-Play" class="headerlink" title="10. MOTO Z2 Play"></a>10.

While the rear camera includes phase detection autofocus, dual-pixel autofocus, laser autofocus, and a dual-tone LED flash, this should imply that low light photos would have an awesome quality. However, this is not always the case since you sometimes, just need to keep tapping to focus what you want. One of the things we noticed was the difference when you’re looking at the photos on the smartphone itself and on another device. The truth is that they look a lot better on the AMOLED screen of the MOTO Z2 Play. When you’re trying to take a photo with low light, the auto night mode will activate. Again, the results weren’t always good or always bad. They kept changing. In what concerns video capabilities, the MOTO Z2 Play allows you to shoot using Full-HD or 4K. Although the videos could be a lot better, they are quite ok. Besides, one of the things that you can easily do is to use the Go Live mode and go live directly on YouTube.</p><p>Check<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >MOTO Z2 Play 4K Smartphone Complete Review &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Recommended-Video-Editor-App-for-Your-New-4K-Camera-Phones"><a href="#Recommended-Video-Editor-App-for-Your-New-4K-Camera-Phones" class="headerlink" title="Recommended Video Editor App for Your New 4K Camera Phones"></a>Recommended Video Editor App for Your New 4K Camera Phones</h2><p>After unboxing your favorite 4K camera phone, it is time to install various apps.

So, simply put, you need to prioritize your needs, what you really appreciate more, and choose the best smartphone for you according to that.

Solid design, simple usage and intuitive multi-touch gesture makes this app an all time winner. Especially when you are answering “ how to shorten a video on iPhone? Despite its editing capabilities, we will keep our focus on video resizing. It’s a video size reducer, that can import file directly from iPhone. There are many options to trim, rotate, duplicate, split or delete clip. By default a photo in a timeline will be a clip for 6 to 12 seconds of onscreen time. Trimming photo will mean cutting the on-screen duration.</p><ul><li>Open the project</li><li>Tap the video or photo in timeline to be shortened</li><li>Drag yellow trim handler to shorten the video or photo</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iMovie-shorten.jpeg"                      alt="imoive"                ></p><p> But, it can be, that you don’t want to delete parts at all. Instead you want to make “large” size a little bit more manageable. For that sake, another way to trim video, iPhone camera roll has ,is, by resizing. But resizing and compressions are tricky. You need to consider video dimension (pixels), aspect ratio and resolution. Above all resizing doesn’t mean sacrificing quality. One best way to do that is to use Desqueeze.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-resize-a-video-on-iPhone"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-resize-a-video-on-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to resize a video on iPhone"></a>Part 2: How to resize a video on iPhone</h2><h4 id="1-Desqueeze"><a href="#1-Desqueeze" class="headerlink" title="1.

Use <strong>Microsoft speech to text</strong> service. This service was launched in 2020 alongside the text-to-speech service, which includes famous computer-generated voices like <strong>Microsoft Sam</strong> and his brother, Mike. So, in this short read, you’ll learn what <strong>Microsoft Azure speech to text</strong> service is and its capabilities. I’ll also introduce you to the best Microsoft Azure STT alternatives. Let’s hunker down!</p><p><strong>Top Alternative to Microsoft Azure STT</strong> Save plenty of time on transcribing subtitles and boost your editing efficiency by applying Filmora Speech-To-Text.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try STT Now <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try STT Now <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Explore STT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/banner/filmora-latest-product-box.png"                      alt="Wondershare Filmora"                ></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Microsoft-Azure-and-Speech-Studio"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Microsoft-Azure-and-Speech-Studio" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Microsoft Azure and Speech Studio?"></a>Part 1: What is Microsoft Azure and Speech Studio?</h2><p>Microsoft Azure STT and TTS are part of <strong>Microsoft Cognitive Services Speech</strong>. These cognitive services feature state-of-the-art intelligence covering voice recognition, speaker recognition, machine translation, and OCR (Optical Character Recognition). The Microsoft speech to text service uses Azure Machine Learning (Azure ML) to auto-recognize, analyze, and convert human voices to editable and searchable texts.</p><p>Having said that, Azure STT lets you transcribe streaming audio, microphone commentary, or local audio files. It supports 100+ languages, including English, German, French, Swahili, Hindi, Ukrainian, Turkish, Arabic, and more. Remember that this service also supports batch transcription, allowing you to transcribe multiple audios in batch.</p><p>In the meantime, Azure STT is available in many formats, including Speech SDK. Speech SDK (Software Development Kit) allows you to use popular programming languages to create a speech-enabled application. It’s compatible with Java, JavaScript, Python, Visual Studio C++, Swift, and Objective-C.</p><p>If you’re not good with programming languages, use Speech CLI, a command tool that allows you to use the speech recognition service without entering a code. Put simply, it features a minimal setup with precise requirements. Plus, it features pretty much everything you’ll find in Speech SDK. So, it depends on your skills and preference.</p><p>It is also worth noting that Azure Speech Studio supports keyword recognition or keyword spotting. You can generate keyword recognition models and specify any short phrase or word. Users can also personalize keywords with the correct punctuations. And best of all, there is no extra cost for customizing keywords.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2105883/7443" target="_top" id="2105883">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2105883" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105883/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Transcribe-Speech-to-Text-with-Microsoft-Speech-Studio"><a href="#Part-2-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Transcribe-Speech-to-Text-with-Microsoft-Speech-Studio" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Step by Step Guide to Transcribe Speech to Text with Microsoft Speech Studio"></a>Part 2: Step by Step Guide to Transcribe Speech to Text with Microsoft Speech Studio</h2><p>Now let’s learn how to use Microsoft Azure speech recognition services. Remember, the conversion may not be accurate if the audio has lots of domain-industry jargon or ambient noises. Therefore, use crisp-clear audio with an external mic or train the software to recognize specific words or keywords. Let’s get started!</p><p>Step1Start by creating a Microsoft Azure account. You’ll start with the free version, which gives you a <strong>$200 credit to use within 30 days</strong>. After depleting the free credits, use the pay-as-you-go model, which unlocks 40+ Azure services.</p><p>Step2After creating a Microsoft Azure portal, you’ll see all Azure services. Click the Speech Services tab or search for “speech services” on the search bar. Now click Create and then fill out the project details. Then, click Review and Create before clicking Create.</p><p>Step3The program will take a while to deploy an instance. Now tap Keys and endpoints on the left pane and copy the key and region identifier as you may need them later on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/microsoft-speech-to-text-1.jpg"                      alt="micrsoft azure speech to text copy key and region"                ></p><p>Step4Download and install Microsoft Visual C++ and .NET Core 3.1 Runtime. Next, install Speech CL on .NET by running this command “**dotnet tool install -global Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech.CLI.**” Alternatively, download and install Speech CLI for Windows PCs as a <a class="link"   href="https://aka.ms/speech/spx-windows" >ZIP file <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Step5Now enter the Azure regional identifier and subscription key on Windows Terminal or PowerShell. To configure the region and key, run these commands; “<strong>spx config @key –set SUBSCRIPTION-KEY</strong> and **spx config @region –set REGION.**”</p><p>Step6Now it’s time to convert speech to text using Azure STT Service. To do that, run “<strong>spx recognize -microphone</strong>” on Terminal or PowerShell. Azure Speech CLI will listen to sound input and convert it to text. And there is that!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"                      alt="icon note"                ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Click <a class="link"   href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/shows/one-dev-minute/how-to-use-the-azure-cognitive-services-net-speech-sdk-for-recognition" >this video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for a detailed guide on how to use Azure Speech Services with Visual Basic (SDK).</p><h2 id="Part-3-What-Are-the-Free-Alternatives-to-the-Microsoft-Speech-to-Text-Service"><a href="#Part-3-What-Are-the-Free-Alternatives-to-the-Microsoft-Speech-to-Text-Service" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What Are the Free Alternatives to the Microsoft Speech to Text Service?"></a>Part 3: What Are the Free Alternatives to the Microsoft Speech to Text Service?</h2><p>We should all agree that using Microsoft Azures Speech Service is not a walk in the park. You need some knowledge of programming and Windows Command Prompt. Even worse, you’ll have to pay each time you want to convert speech to text after depleting the free credits.</p><p>Fortunately, there’s no shortage of free speech to text converters for beginners. So, in this part, we’ll discuss some free Microsoft Azure STT alternatives for beginners.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2100530/7443" target="_top" id="2100530">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2100530" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2100530/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#1-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="1.

Most of you may not be aware that Google Docs can accurately convert speech to text. This makes it a handy tool if you find speaking easier than writing. As expected, this voice transcription tool recognizes hundreds of languages, like English, French, Italian, Hindi, etc.</p><p>But although it does a commendable job, less-than-clear audio won’t give you accurate transcriptions. Also, it doesn’t feature niceties like periods, commas, and other punctuations. As such, stick to a professional app like Filmora to transcribe your audio to text.</p><p>Steps to convert voice to text with Google Docs:</p><p>Step1Open a new document on Google Docs and then click Voice typing. The inbuilt microphone will automatically launch.</p><p>Step2Next, click the language drop-down arrow on the microphone to choose the transcription language. You can dictate texts in English, Espanol, French, Italian, Afrikaans, Arabic, and more.</p><p>Step3Click the Microphone icon to start dictating texts on Google Docs. After dictating enough texts, tap the red Microphone icon and edit your text.

In case you have already such a thing on your device or in the Canva library, you should open it in the editor’s interface. After that, you should work on adding audio files.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Upload Audio</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/canva-video-2.png"                      alt="Audio upload to Canva"                ></p><p>Secondly, you should proceed with a small procedure of uploading audio files to the Canva. Canva allows uploading any kind of file from external sources or devices. It can be useful in adding desired audio and sound effects to the video.

Here, you should visit the AUDIO tab from the side panel. In case you cannot see such an option, you will definitely get the MORE button, so, proceed by clicking it. After exploring more, you can easily see that particular button.</p><p><strong>Step 5:Add Audio To Design</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/canva-video-4.png"                      alt="add audio to design"                ></p><p>In the audio tab, you can see the recently uploaded final.
