Don’t always think about the money and the free product, but think about how you can do your job well without faking your reaction.</p><p>Every video you post need to bring value to your viewers. You might really want to create branded content and build a partnership, but if the content you produce doesn’t line up with your brand, your audience won’t care about it and even your channel and the brand will suffer at the end.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Brand Collaboration may benefit your channel and also the brand itself, the end goal may still be to sell but business must address consumers differently, transform them first into an audience, then ask permission to distill your marketing message into meaningful content. Brand should also be listening carefully to their audience responding to their comments, questions and suggestions.</p><p>When doing a brand collaboration, you must remember don’t lose hope, your first few attempts might not return anything. Keep trying and keep making awesome content. Bigger the following, easier it is to get sponsorship. Just focus on your goal and don’t be disappointed you might get what your dream of in the perfect time.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"

In addition, gaming monitors are a completely new concept for many console owners. It was easy to choose a 4K TV with Xbox One, but we experienced some interesting alternatives when the next generation came along.</p><p>As console owners gravitate toward monitors in order to take advantage of the incredible framerates and resolutions the Xbox Series X can deliver, the pull of monitors appears to be increasing. Let’s check out some of our top picks for the best monitors for Xbox Series X, and keep in mind that HDMI 2.1 monitors are on the way, so if you’re interested in seeing what’s coming, please head over to our top picks.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/xbox-seriesx.jpg"                      alt="xbox-seriesx"                ></p><h4 id="Using-a-monitor-with-Xbox-Series-X"><a href="#Using-a-monitor-with-Xbox-Series-X" class="headerlink" title="Using a monitor with Xbox Series X"></a><strong>Using a monitor with Xbox Series X</strong></h4><p>The best way to enjoy Xbox Series X is to get a monitor that supports either 8K at 60hz or 4K at 120hz, which means that you’ll need an HDMI 2.1 monitor. In spite of the fact that there are some amazing HDMI 2.1 cable options out there, HDMI 2.1 monitors are not as common as they could be at this moment, but we expect them to appear soon.</p><p>Accordingly, the most common monitor options available for Xbox Series X gamers as of right now are 1080p at 120Hz, 1440p at 120Hz, or 4K at 60Hz. Even though 120hz gaming doesn’t require an HDMI 2.1 monitor, one popular approach involves lowering the resolution while increasing framerates. The ability to play either racing or FPS games at 1080p at 120Hz would be an example of this.</p><hr><p><strong>You might be interested in:</strong></p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Best Monitors For Your ps5 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Best TVs You Can Find in 2024 for ps5 and Xbox Series X <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><hr><p><strong>Our Top Picks For Best Xbox Series X Monitors</strong></p><h4 id="1-Samsung-Odyssey-G7-32-Inch"><a href="#1-Samsung-Odyssey-G7-32-Inch" class="headerlink" title="1.

It features a contrast ratio of 3000:1 and HDR, giving gamers a more immersive and realistic gaming experience. There is no question that this is not a ‘budget’ monitor, but its design is pretty epic (with LEDs too), and it could work well with a number of different types of games, including fast-paced FPSes as well as upcoming slower and dramatic releases.</p><h4 id="3-ASUS-VP28UQG-28-Inch-4K"><a href="#3-ASUS-VP28UQG-28-Inch-4K" class="headerlink" title="3.

The monitor has outstanding motion handling and an excellent 1080p resolution. The stand allows you to adjust the ergonomics and it’s decently well-built. There are wide viewing angles on the IPS panel, which makes it easy to see even in bright settings. As a result of its low contrast ratio, it is not suitable for dark rooms.</p><p>There are no blur trails behind fast-moving objects because the display is exceptionally responsive, whether you play at 120Hz or 60Hz. Additionally, it has an image duplication-free backlight, which reduces eye strain and reduces eye strain. The variable refresh rate works in a wide range of refresh rates, so even if frame rates are low, you get almost no tearing.</p><h4 id="5-DELL-S2721QS"><a href="#5-DELL-S2721QS" class="headerlink" title="5.

It also has an IPS panel but is an inch smaller than the Acer Nitro XV282K. However, it still offers good response times and VRR support despite its lack of HDMI 2.1 ports and 60Hz refresh rate.

So if you are thinking to buy a new camera for your adventurous tours then you need to make a careful decision out of all existing competitive brands. <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Xiaomi YI 4K <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is one of the highly rated action camera under this competing category.

Both of these are compared in detail as below:</p><h4 id="1-Hardware"><a href="#1-Hardware" class="headerlink" title="1.Hardware"></a>1.Hardware</h4><p><strong>Touch Screen:</strong> When displays of both these cameras are compared then it was observed that YI 4K provides better response as compared to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >GoPro Hero5 Black <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Size of display is also larger in case of YI 4K as it goes up to 2.19” whereas Hero5 has 2” screen. The Touch Screen is found more interactive in YI 4K whereas in case of Hero5 you may need to press twice especially when it is wet. The front LCD display of GoPro provides additional settings menu for easy control.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/yi-4k-touchscreen.jpg"                      alt="Yi 4K action camera touchscreen"                ></p><p> Image source:elproducente.com</p><p><strong>Waterproof:</strong> The biggest benefit of GoPro Hero5 is that it can serve you underwater but YI 4K cannot as you need additional protective case for this camera. But you cannot save your recordings from handling noise in case of GoPro unit. When you go underwater with YI 4K while using protective housing then it is not possible to use its touch screen feature and secondly the audio quality decays by large extent.</p><p><strong>Battery Life:</strong> Both of these camera units come with removable batteries but in case of Hero5 you can enjoy recording only up to 1hr 40 minutes with its 1220mAh battery backup whereas the YI 4K camera is developed with 1400mAh battery that can serve perfectly for 2 hours. Prefer to use these cameras with WiFi connections turned off in order to save battery for longer duration.</p><h4 id="2-Performance"><a href="#2-Performance" class="headerlink" title="2.Performance"></a>2.Performance</h4><p><strong>Image Resolution:</strong> Photo quality of both cameras is 12MP and digital image stabilization feature is added to both units. You can find much warmer and smoother quality with Yi 4K whereas GoPro offers services for RAW photography.</p><p><strong>Video Resolution:</strong> When we talk about the video resolution then different ratings must be compared to get better idea about performance. When we talk about Go Pro Hero5 then maximum video quality is offered to be 4K at 30fps, 2.7k at 60fps, 1080p with 120fps and 720p at 240fps. On the other side in case of Xiaomi YI 4K you will be able to avail 4K at 30fps, 2.5K at 30fps, 1440p with 60fps, 1080p for 120fps and 720p with 200fps only.</p><p><strong>Audio Quality:</strong> Audio Quality of GoPro Hero5 is rated to be much superior as compared to Yi 4K camera unit. The housing helps to protect Hero5 from wind noise but it can perform even better without housing as compared to Yi 4K. Hero5 Black comes with 3 microphones and it helps to make better selection for audio streams.</p><p><strong>Price:</strong> GoPro Hero5 can be ordered online with a payment of $399 but you will be glad to know that equally featured Xiaomi Yi Action Camera is cheaper as well as affordable with a price tag of $199.99 only. When we compare specs and hardware of both these cameras then Yi 4K is observed to provide all desired high performance results while meeting all needs of sports persons so you can think of buying Xiaomi product that falls in your budget.</p><h4 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h4><p> Almost all features are discussed above and it is observed that if you are searching for a camera to record videos underwater or in rainy seasons then it is best idea to invest on GoPro Hero5 but in case of other adventurous sports activities Yi 4K can also provide you impressive results and it is a fit to budget camera unit.

We have all seen the commercials where senior people have a shaky video, and after it is fixed, we see that they are doing some amazing things but aren’t even moving. Shake reduction is one of the best features of Photoshop. It removes shakiness from a video, but it can also remove the movement from a picture. In this article, we’ll look at the use of Photoshop shake reduction, how it works, what it does, and how you can avoid using it.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">What is the Photoshop Shake Reduction effect?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">Is the Shake Reduction effect really useful to fix the camera shake?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">How to use Shake Reduction in Photoshop?</a></p><h2 id="What-is-the-Photoshop-Shake-Reduction-effect"><a href="#What-is-the-Photoshop-Shake-Reduction-effect" class="headerlink" title="What is the Photoshop Shake Reduction effect?"></a>What is the Photoshop Shake Reduction effect?</h2><p>The Shake Reduction effect is something that many photographers do not need. It was added to Photoshop because of the number of pictures coming in with a blurring caused by camera movement while the shutter button was pressed. This blurring is called camera shake, and it can be not easy to get rid of in post-processing if you don’t have tools to help you fix it. The Shake Reduction feature introduced in Photoshop attempts to help with this problem.</p><p>The Shake Reduction effect in Photoshop is a very useful feature that allows you to remove the effects of camera shake from your photos. It can also be used as a creative effect, allowing you to distort your images for some interesting effects intentionally.</p><p>Trying to take great photos with a handheld camera will always result in some blurring and camera shake. Even the best photographers can’t hold the camera completely steady for long periods of time. Unless you’re on a tripod, there’s always the chance that your photos are going to end up slightly blurred, especially if you’re shooting in low light or at high speeds.</p><p>The Shake Reduction effect in Photoshop allows you to fix this problem by removing the blur and restoring crispness to your images.</p><h2 id="Is-the-Shake-Reduction-effect-really-useful-to-fix-the-camera-shake"><a href="#Is-the-Shake-Reduction-effect-really-useful-to-fix-the-camera-shake" class="headerlink" title="Is the Shake Reduction effect really useful to fix the camera shake?"></a>Is the Shake Reduction effect really useful to fix the camera shake?</h2><p>The perfect shot is a fine balance of elements. You need the right lighting and the ideal setting, and you must also have precise timing. When it comes to taking a picture or photo, timing is very important. You don’t want to miss that perfect moment when the sun rays behind the clouds hit your face just right or when you capture your friend jumping off a diving board at just the right angle.</p><p>But sometimes, even if you do have everything in place and make sure you get the timing right, your picture can still turn out to be blurry. That’s where the Photoshop Shake Reduction effect comes in handy.</p><p>Shake Reduction is a feature that creates motion blur from camera shake, and many photographers consider it to be one of the most useful tools in Photoshop.</p><p>Some photographers prefer to use the Photoshop Shake Reduction effect instead of dealing with blurry photos. The main reason for this is that it can help them save time and effort when editing their images.</p><p>The Shake Reduction filter can also correct for perspective distortion introduced by tilting the camera up or down. It can compensate for uneven lighting, too. And one of the features that I find most impressive is that it can automatically remove video noise from old video transfers.</p><p>Truly, this effect is very useful, but not necessarily for fixing camera shake. In this tutorial, we will show you how to use Shake Reduction to create realistic depictions of motion. You will learn how to achieve different results by modifying the settings of Shake Reduction and combining it with other effects and filters in Photoshop.</p><h2 id="How-to-use-Shake-Reduction-in-Photoshop"><a href="#How-to-use-Shake-Reduction-in-Photoshop" class="headerlink" title="How to use Shake Reduction in Photoshop?"></a>How to use Shake Reduction in Photoshop?</h2><p>A special Photoshop filter called Camera Shake Reduction can reduce blurriness in any image. Several factors can lead to blurred images, including slow shutter speeds, long focal lengths, and unsteady hands. Smart extrapolation detects the blurry path and sharpens the image at those points. Besides controlling sharpening for different areas of an image, the Filter’s interface also lets you override Photoshop’s auto-analysis. Want to use the photoshop shake reduction effect?

We have all seen the commercials where senior people have a shaky video, and after it is fixed, we see that they are doing some amazing things but aren’t even moving. Shake reduction is one of the best features of Photoshop. It removes shakiness from a video, but it can also remove the movement from a picture. In this article, we’ll look at the use of Photoshop shake reduction, how it works, what it does, and how you can avoid using it.</p><h4 id="In-this-article-1"><a href="#In-this-article-1" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">What is the Photoshop Shake Reduction effect?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">Is the Shake Reduction effect really useful to fix the camera shake?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">How to use Shake Reduction in Photoshop?</a></p><h2 id="What-is-the-Photoshop-Shake-Reduction-effect-1"><a href="#What-is-the-Photoshop-Shake-Reduction-effect-1" class="headerlink" title="What is the Photoshop Shake Reduction effect?"></a>What is the Photoshop Shake Reduction effect?</h2><p>The Shake Reduction effect is something that many photographers do not need. It was added to Photoshop because of the number of pictures coming in with a blurring caused by camera movement while the shutter button was pressed. This blurring is called camera shake, and it can be not easy to get rid of in post-processing if you don’t have tools to help you fix it. The Shake Reduction feature introduced in Photoshop attempts to help with this problem.</p><p>The Shake Reduction effect in Photoshop is a very useful feature that allows you to remove the effects of camera shake from your photos. It can also be used as a creative effect, allowing you to distort your images for some interesting effects intentionally.</p><p>Trying to take great photos with a handheld camera will always result in some blurring and camera shake. Even the best photographers can’t hold the camera completely steady for long periods of time. Unless you’re on a tripod, there’s always the chance that your photos are going to end up slightly blurred, especially if you’re shooting in low light or at high speeds.</p><p>The Shake Reduction effect in Photoshop allows you to fix this problem by removing the blur and restoring crispness to your images.</p><h2 id="Is-the-Shake-Reduction-effect-really-useful-to-fix-the-camera-shake-1"><a href="#Is-the-Shake-Reduction-effect-really-useful-to-fix-the-camera-shake-1" class="headerlink" title="Is the Shake Reduction effect really useful to fix the camera shake?"></a>Is the Shake Reduction effect really useful to fix the camera shake?</h2><p>The perfect shot is a fine balance of elements. You need the right lighting and the ideal setting, and you must also have precise timing. When it comes to taking a picture or photo, timing is very important. You don’t want to miss that perfect moment when the sun rays behind the clouds hit your face just right or when you capture your friend jumping off a diving board at just the right angle.</p><p>But sometimes, even if you do have everything in place and make sure you get the timing right, your picture can still turn out to be blurry. That’s where the Photoshop Shake Reduction effect comes in handy.</p><p>Shake Reduction is a feature that creates motion blur from camera shake, and many photographers consider it to be one of the most useful tools in Photoshop.</p><p>Some photographers prefer to use the Photoshop Shake Reduction effect instead of dealing with blurry photos. The main reason for this is that it can help them save time and effort when editing their images.</p><p>The Shake Reduction filter can also correct for perspective distortion introduced by tilting the camera up or down. It can compensate for uneven lighting, too. And one of the features that I find most impressive is that it can automatically remove video noise from old video transfers.</p><p>Truly, this effect is very useful, but not necessarily for fixing camera shake. In this tutorial, we will show you how to use Shake Reduction to create realistic depictions of motion. You will learn how to achieve different results by modifying the settings of Shake Reduction and combining it with other effects and filters in Photoshop.</p><h2 id="How-to-use-Shake-Reduction-in-Photoshop-1"><a href="#How-to-use-Shake-Reduction-in-Photoshop-1" class="headerlink" title="How to use Shake Reduction in Photoshop?"></a>How to use Shake Reduction in Photoshop?</h2><p>A special Photoshop filter called Camera Shake Reduction can reduce blurriness in any image. Several factors can lead to blurred images, including slow shutter speeds, long focal lengths, and unsteady hands. Smart extrapolation detects the blurry path and sharpens the image at those points.

If there’s any hope of getting this feature to work for these images, you’d have to zoom back out and try reducing camera shake again. Some might find this frustrating, but it’s necessary if you’re trying to alleviate a lot of blur in your images.</p><p><strong>●</strong>Photoshop Shake Reduction is really useful when you want to reduce the shake and blurriness caused by the slow shutter speeds that camera phones inherently use. It’s quite simply a great feature for those who only shoot with their smartphones, but if you can afford a better camera, we would recommend using a tripod instead - it will always be better than Photoshop Shake Reduction.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Is <strong>Shake Reduction</strong> in Photoshop useful? We have all seen the commercials where senior people have a shaky video, and after it is fixed, we see that they are doing some amazing things but aren’t even moving. Shake reduction is one of the best features of Photoshop. It removes shakiness from a video, but it can also remove the movement from a picture. In this article, we’ll look at the use of Photoshop shake reduction, how it works, what it does, and how you can avoid using it.</p><h4 id="In-this-article-3"><a href="#In-this-article-3" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">What is the Photoshop Shake Reduction effect?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">Is the Shake Reduction effect really useful to fix the camera shake?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">How to use Shake Reduction in Photoshop?</a></p><h2 id="What-is-the-Photoshop-Shake-Reduction-effect-3"><a href="#What-is-the-Photoshop-Shake-Reduction-effect-3" class="headerlink" title="What is the Photoshop Shake Reduction effect?"></a>What is the Photoshop Shake Reduction effect?</h2><p>The Shake Reduction effect is something that many photographers do not need. It was added to Photoshop because of the number of pictures coming in with a blurring caused by camera movement while the shutter button was pressed. This blurring is called camera shake, and it can be not easy to get rid of in post-processing if you don’t have tools to help you fix it. The Shake Reduction feature introduced in Photoshop attempts to help with this problem.</p><p>The Shake Reduction effect in Photoshop is a very useful feature that allows you to remove the effects of camera shake from your photos. It can also be used as a creative effect, allowing you to distort your images for some interesting effects intentionally.</p><p>Trying to take great photos with a handheld camera will always result in some blurring and camera shake. Even the best photographers can’t hold the camera completely steady for long periods of time. Unless you’re on a tripod, there’s always the chance that your photos are going to end up slightly blurred, especially if you’re shooting in low light or at high speeds.</p><p>The Shake Reduction effect in Photoshop allows you to fix this problem by removing the blur and restoring crispness to your images.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=40203538&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/cc4b82e826b52ec41c810301548e8f48/products/audio-to-text-transcription-software.png"                      border="0"                >EaseText Audio to Text Converter for Windows (Personal Edition) - An intelligent tool to transcribe &amp; convert audio to text freely </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Is-the-Shake-Reduction-effect-really-useful-to-fix-the-camera-shake-3"><a href="#Is-the-Shake-Reduction-effect-really-useful-to-fix-the-camera-shake-3" class="headerlink" title="Is the Shake Reduction effect really useful to fix the camera shake?"></a>Is the Shake Reduction effect really useful to fix the camera shake?</h2><p>The perfect shot is a fine balance of elements. You need the right lighting and the ideal setting, and you must also have precise timing. When it comes to taking a picture or photo, timing is very important. You don’t want to miss that perfect moment when the sun rays behind the clouds hit your face just right or when you capture your friend jumping off a diving board at just the right angle.</p><p>But sometimes, even if you do have everything in place and make sure you get the timing right, your picture can still turn out to be blurry. That’s where the Photoshop Shake Reduction effect comes in handy.</p><p>Shake Reduction is a feature that creates motion blur from camera shake, and many photographers consider it to be one of the most useful tools in Photoshop.</p><p>Some photographers prefer to use the Photoshop Shake Reduction effect instead of dealing with blurry photos. The main reason for this is that it can help them save time and effort when editing their images.</p><p>The Shake Reduction filter can also correct for perspective distortion introduced by tilting the camera up or down. It can compensate for uneven lighting, too. And one of the features that I find most impressive is that it can automatically remove video noise from old video transfers.</p><p>Truly, this effect is very useful, but not necessarily for fixing camera shake. In this tutorial, we will show you how to use Shake Reduction to create realistic depictions of motion. You will learn how to achieve different results by modifying the settings of Shake Reduction and combining it with other effects and filters in Photoshop.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4709458&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://3d-kstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Project-Manager-version-3-1600x900-768x419.jpg"                      border="0"                >Project Manager - Asset Browser for 3Ds Max</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-use-Shake-Reduction-in-Photoshop-3"><a href="#How-to-use-Shake-Reduction-in-Photoshop-3" class="headerlink" title="How to use Shake Reduction in Photoshop?"></a>How to use Shake Reduction in Photoshop?</h2><p>A special Photoshop filter called Camera Shake Reduction can reduce blurriness in any image.

If you are looking for a video editor like this, I would recommend Filmora for you.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Shake reduction</strong> is a neat little feature that has a few quirks, one being the fact that it doesn’t seem to work very well if you’re already zoomed in on your image when you try to reduce camera shake. If there’s any hope of getting this feature to work for these images, you’d have to zoom back out and try reducing camera shake again. Some might find this frustrating, but it’s necessary if you’re trying to alleviate a lot of blur in your images.</p><p><strong>●</strong>Photoshop Shake Reduction is really useful when you want to reduce the shake and blurriness caused by the slow shutter speeds that camera phones inherently use. It’s quite simply a great feature for those who only shoot with their smartphones, but if you can afford a better camera, we would recommend using a tripod instead - it will always be better than Photoshop Shake Reduction.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"

As the word ‘Focus’ itself defines as centre of interest, it helps to keep our image subject as the main part by emphasizing and giving attention to exactly what we want to capture in the image. But how many of you have come across a situation where iPhone camera focus fails to work. An out of focus photography clearly looks clumsy as due to the blurriness. The iPhone camera not focusing issue usually appears and many people get annoyed by unclear picture. Thus, with the help of this article, we will make you aware about some tips you can attempt to fix the issue.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part1: The Easiest Way—Auto Focus</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part2: Lock AE&#x2F;AF</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part3: Stand too close is not good</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part4: Upgrade iOS</a></li><li><a href="#part5">Part5: Turn off your iPhone</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part1-The-Easiest-Way—Auto-Focus"><a href="#Part1-The-Easiest-Way—Auto-Focus" class="headerlink" title="Part1: The Easiest Way—Auto Focus"></a>Part1: The Easiest Way—Auto Focus</h2><p> When you are getting troubles with iPhone camera focus, perhaps you are trying to focus a subject other than someone’s face. Putting it simply, iPhone camera’s autofocus feature is designed to make it powerful enough to read the face and focus it automatically. If there is no face, the iPhone will focus on the center itself. There is a yellow squared box which will let you identify the focusing part. But having the subject at the center is not necessary every time. If this is the case, you need to simply tap on the same part of the srceen where the subject is and the camera app will begin focusing on it. Check if it works or else go down to the next tip.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/auto-focus.jpg"                      alt="auto focus"                ></p><h2 id="Part2-Lock-AE-AF"><a href="#Part2-Lock-AE-AF" class="headerlink" title="Part2: Lock AE&#x2F;AF"></a>Part2: Lock AE&#x2F;AF</h2><p> As in the above tip, we explained to tap on the srceen where you wish to set the focus. However, sometimes, single tapping on the srceen isn’t sufficient. This is because if any kind of movement happens in the scene or if you move, the camera will start re-adjusting its focus which obviously you don’t want. If you seriously want to take a better picture, make sure to lock the focus on the subject in the scene. This can be done by enabling AE&#x2F;AF feature and doing this will keep the focus on the subject even if anything moves in the scene. To do this, just tap and hold on the subject for a few seconds until you get to see a yellow box at the top of the srceen saying “AE&#x2F;AF LOCK”. Once you notice, you can release your fingers and start having fun with picture capturing moment.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/ae-lock.jpg"                      alt="auto focus"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://aspironcom.sjv.io/c/5597632/1941789/21554" target="_top" id="1941789"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21554-1941789"                      border="0" alt="" width="650" height="800"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1941789/21554"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part3-Stand-too-close-is-not-good"><a href="#Part3-Stand-too-close-is-not-good" class="headerlink" title="Part3: Stand too close is not good"></a>Part3: Stand too close is not good</h2><p> If you are not getting standard iPhone focus, check if you are standing too near to the subject. Probably this is the case, and if yes, the problem of focus got the solution. Make sure to stand at least three inches apart from the subject. This is because the camera of iPhone is designed in a way that it can’t give you clear picture if it is placed too close to the subject. All in all, if you are holding your iPhone excessively close to the subject, pull it back little inches otherwise you will end up clicking a blurred photo.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/close.jpg"                      alt="stand too close"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.emeditor.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4610657&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.emeditor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/emeditor_chat_ai.png"                      border="0"                ><br>EmEditor is a fast, lightweight, yet extensible, easy-to-use text editor, code editor, CSV editor, and large file viewer for Windows.

By making use of the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >GoPro Studio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you will be able to add a lot of creative touches to your video. In today’s post we are about to discuss how to do the perfect color correction on GoPro Studio and how to edit the footage captured on your action camera.</p><p><strong>You may also like:</strong></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Color Grading and Correction in Final Cut Pro &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Color-Correction-in-GoPro-Studio"><a href="#Color-Correction-in-GoPro-Studio" class="headerlink" title="Color Correction in GoPro Studio"></a>Color Correction in GoPro Studio</h2><p> One of the easiest and most convenient ways of making the most out of your action camera is to use the <a class="link"   href="https://gopro.com/support/articles/how-to-use-protune" >“Protune” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> setting. The Protune among other things is capable of enhancing the dynamic recording range. The enhanced dynamic range would offer you a flat log like image which appears more vigorous while during color grading.</p><p> No matter whether you are recording with Protune turned on or off, you will be required to adjust the colors during the time of the edit. Color Correction in GoPro Studio is simple and intuitive.</p><p> Just follow the steps below:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> The first thing you have to do is setting the cam to the Protune shooting mode. Now just import and get your Protune footage converted.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Split the Image- On the right of the screen there is a split button. You need to shift the point almost halfway. Doing this would split the window in ½ though you will not be able to see that. When the color profile of the image is changed the right side is going to change without affecting the left side. This would allow you to compare the image as it was before and after correcting the color. In order to view the original image or the edited one you have to draw the pointer to the right or left.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-gopro-studio-0.jpg"                      alt="Color correction in GoPro Studio"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Color Correction- On the right hand side of your window the color correction can be done just by hitting on the arrow beside the White Balance button and the Image button. Now you can see the options which needed to be changed in order to correct the color. You will be able to view all the options like temperature, exposure, sharpness, contrast, tint and saturation. You can also choose to apply different preset overlays to give the footage a special filter.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-gopro-studio-1.jpg"                      alt="how to do color correction in GoPro Studio"                ></p><p> The GoPro Studio is very user friendly and effective video editing software but in order to use it you need to convert the format of your video before you start to edit. There aren’t many options especially when you require enhanced controls on the GoPro recordings. This is why we would recommend you to use the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> editing software. It is equipped with a special action cam tool which not only allows the user to alter the color by changing the brightness, saturation, vignette, tint or temp but even comes with loads of 3D LUT filters which adds a nice effect.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><p> The all new version of the Wondershare Filmora editing software for Windows and Mac is packed with exciting features meant exclusively for action cameras.

It would allow you to cut a 8GB footage within just a minutes time.</li><li>It fully supports  encoded MP4 format, MTS and Mov videos shot on any action cams, camcorders and phones.</li></ol><h2 id="GoPro-Footage-Color-Correction-in-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#GoPro-Footage-Color-Correction-in-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="GoPro Footage Color Correction in Wondershare Filmora"></a>GoPro Footage Color Correction in Wondershare Filmora</h2><p> In order to do the color correction in Filmora you just need to follow the 3 easy steps.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Import the file. After opening the Filmora app go to the Action Cam Tool right on the interface of the software. Now click on the import button or just drag and drop your clip shot on any action cam into the middle of your timeline.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/1-action-cam-tool-fix-entrance.jpg"                      alt="color correction"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Color Tuning. Now you need to choose the Color Tab on the left of your control panel. Here you will be able to drag the individual slider so as to alter the contrast, brightness, tint, vignette and saturation.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-corretion-in-gopro-studio-3.jpg"                      alt="correct gopro footage color"                ></p><p> The compare button located on the top right lets you check all the segments before and after the correction simultaneously. While the Reset button <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/color-tuning-reset-button.png"                      alt="color-tuning-reset-button"                > would allow you to clear all the color corrections anytime.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Save and Share- Once the edit is finished you need to hit the Export button in order to save the edited clip as MOV or MP4 format. You can also alter the video res and the frames per sec. Now just hit the OK button to start the export.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"
