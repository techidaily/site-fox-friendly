It works by taking multiple pictures at different exposures and then combining them into one photo.

Here are five benefits of using Auto HDR on your iPhone</p><ul><li>You can avoid editing your photos in post-processing, which saves time and reduces the risk of errors;</li><li>Auto HDR applies different levels of saturation and contrast depending on what you’re photographing, giving you more accurate colors;</li><li>It uses face detection to properly expose portraits; -</li><li>It improves details in low light situations; and</li><li>It’s enabled by default in iOS 11 so you don’t have to do anything.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/what-are-auto-hdr-smart-hdr-3-and-4-shooting-modes-5.jpg"                      alt="auto hdr"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://tinyland.pxf.io/c/5597632/1793214/19135" target="_top" id="1793214"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19135-1793214"                      border="0" alt="" width="900" height="900"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1793214/19135"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Should-you-Lookout-for-the-HDR-feature-on-iPhone-14-1"><a href="#Should-you-Lookout-for-the-HDR-feature-on-iPhone-14-1" class="headerlink" title="Should you Lookout for the HDR feature on iPhone 14?"></a>Should you Lookout for the HDR feature on iPhone 14?</h2><p>The rumor mill is generating leaks about a possible new 48 MP main sensor for the next-generation iPhone 14 Pro camera. Some features of this camera may include more-realistic colors and better low-light performance in addition to all of the other specs we have been hearing about recently.</p><p>If these rumors prove true, it’s possible that Apple will introduce an even more robust and efficient HDR system than what we see on iPhones today.</p><ul><li>iPhone 14 camera will come with a 48 Megapixel sensor. It is rumored that there would be more-realistic colors and better low light performance too.</li><li>8K video recording is a simple resolution bump for the Pro models. For example, if you record a 4K video at 30 frames per second (fps), then your videos playback at 15 fps when played back on an iPhone.</li><li>The selfie cameras of the iPhone 14 models will also receive a major upgrade. The new front-facing sensors are said to offer three times as many pixels.

your photos, making them look much better than they would with traditional camera techniques.</p><p>Auto HDR will make sure both shadows and highlights are in focus, while Smart HDR 3 or 4 take it one

It’s a chance to express yourself, a platform to share your ideas and thoughts with people. Also, to show people who you are and what you’re about—the beauty of solo podcasting. You are free, and it’s a great feeling.

What is it about your show that makes people want to listen? Your hook should always be unique, but a little commonality doesn’t hurt.</p><p>If you’re struggling to come up with a hook for an episode of your podcast, here are a few ideas for you to consider:</p><ul><li>What topic do you enjoy talking about?</li><li>What do you want to learn about?</li><li>Is there something, in particular, you’re interested in?</li></ul><h3 id="Mind-the-length-of-your-solo-podcast-1"><a href="#Mind-the-length-of-your-solo-podcast-1" class="headerlink" title="Mind the length of your solo podcast"></a>Mind the length of your solo podcast</h3><p>Length is everything. Podcasting is about the length of your content, and you will struggle if you have a short episode. You need at least 30 minutes of material for your episode, or you risk alienating listeners and driving them away from your brand.</p><p>You’ll lose listeners’ attention if you don’t know what to say during your episode. So instead, think of your podcast as a mini-publication. You can get away with making shorter episodes because you can fill more content into your episodes.</p><h3 id="Recap-the-episode-1"><a href="#Recap-the-episode-1" class="headerlink" title="Recap the episode"></a>Recap the episode</h3><p>Recapping the previous episode is a great way to start your podcast. Doing so allows your listeners to quickly catch up while at the same time giving you a chance to share the most relevant information from the last show.</p><p>That way, when the next podcast episode starts, your listeners will already be up-to-date on essential information.</p><h3 id="The-right-tool-for-recording-and-editing-1"><a href="#The-right-tool-for-recording-and-editing-1" class="headerlink" title="The right tool for recording and editing"></a>The right tool for recording and editing</h3><p>As the popularity of podcasts continues to grow, so does the need for quality, professional sound recordings and editing tools.</p><p>If you’re a podcaster looking to record and edit, Wondershare Filmora must be your priority.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><strong>Wondershare Filmora</strong></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/solo-podcasting-4.jpg"                      alt="wondershare filmora"                ></p><p>For those who would like to produce podcasts or videos on the go, Wondershare Filmora is not only an easy-to-use video editing software but also a good helper for podcast editing.</p><ul><li>Speech-to-text allows smooth conversion of voiceover to text, making your podcasts more accessible.</li><li>Over 2000+ audio resources range from music, audio effects and much more.</li><li>Remove background noise, fade in, fade out, and do lots more audio editing without hassles.</li><li>Supports many shortcut key commands to help tech-savvy and non-tec-savvy individuals to create and edit podcasts quickly.</li><li>Audio Ducking to easily eliminate background noise and unwanted sound recorded while creating podcasts.</li></ul><p>You can export your episodes as MP3 files, which can then be uploaded to any podcast hosting site like iTunes, Podomatic, and Libsyn.

Before you scratch your head to baldness, all these platforms allow you to upload and view videos on-demand. However, the technology that supports this function is much deeper. From the time you shoot your video until you share it with the world, it has undergone several post-production procedures, including compression using the AV1 codec.</p><p>The following is everything you need to know about the AV1 codec. As you keep reading, you will learn about the history of codec AV1, why it is popular, and its application in your video post-production. In addition, you will discover the best video editors to use when working with AV1 format videos. So let your journey to video editing supremacy begin.</p><ol><li><a href="#part1-1">What is a codec, and what is the AV01 codec</a></li><li><a href="#part1-2">Is it popular</a></li><li><a href="#part1-3">Where is AV1 codec used</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part2">What are the best video editors to edit an AV1 format video</a></li></ul><ol><li><a href="#part2-1">Avidemux</a>  </li><li><a href="#part2-2">Lightworks</a>  </li><li><a href="#part2-3">Filmora Video Editor</a>  </li><li><a href="#part2-4">Movavi Video Editor</a>  </li><li><a href="#part2-5">VirtualDub</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part3">FAQ</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part1-What-is-the-av01-codec"><a href="#Part1-What-is-the-av01-codec" class="headerlink" title="Part1: What is the av01 codec?"></a>Part1: What is the av01 codec?</h2><p>Initially, companies relied on proprietary technology to provide you with video content. For example, most video providers were using variants of MPEG codecs to edit their online content, with others preferring  for 4K content. However, using this method proved expensive and meant that some companies were missing out on the lucrative video streaming market.</p><p>As such, the Alliance for Open Media was formed in 2015 to develop an open-source, royalty-free video codec to outperform all previous versions. Through this collaboration, the Aomedia Video 1 (AV1) codec came to be. Here are some questions to help you understand the technology much better.</p><h3 id="What-is-a-codec-and-what-is-the-AV01-codec"><a href="#What-is-a-codec-and-what-is-the-AV01-codec" class="headerlink" title="What is a codec, and what is the AV01 codec?"></a>What is a codec, and what is the AV01 codec?</h3><p>A codec is a type of compression technology that consists of two parts:</p><ul><li>An encoder compresses the original file to smaller sizes that you can share through the internet or other portable storage.</li><li>A decoder to decompress the file to its original format.</li></ul><p>In addition, you can use different types of codecs depending on the file format. For example, MPEG codecs were the preferred choice for video files. However, streaming companies now use codec AV1 for their content. This is because it offers faster compression times and smaller files than other previous video codecs.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.mondly.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=ATISTUDI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mondly.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D%2BEducational%2B970x90%2B"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/69c418c33ec2e1a4267fa9bb77fa1428/educational-970x90.gif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Is-it-popular"><a href="#Is-it-popular" class="headerlink" title="Is it popular?"></a>Is it popular?</h3><p>Yes, it is. Since its introduction in May 2018, more companies have been integrating the codec in their offerings. Here is a list of companies that offer AV1 codec support:</p><ul><li>Google offers AV1 codec support for Chrome web browser and all Android 10+ smart devices, including your mobile and smart TV. In addition, you can also video chat on Google Duo using the AV1 codec.</li><li>Microsoft also offers AV1 codec support for their Edge browser.</li><li>Other companies that offer codec AV1 support with their software include Opera, Mozilla Firefox, VLC Media Player, and Vivaldi.</li><li>Samsung and LG support 8K streaming on their Q950TS and ZX-OLED TVs, respectively.</li><li>Intel and NVIDIA also offer HD AV1 support with their graphics processing units.</li><li>Additionally, video content providers such as Amazon, Netflix, and YouTube offer AV01 codec support through their devices and online platforms.</li><li>Following successful tests in 2018, Facebook now uses the AV1 codec for videos on the platform.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://turtlebeacheu.sjv.io/c/5597632/1996818/23722" target="_top" id="1996818"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/23722-1996818"                      border="0" alt="" width="600" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1996818/23722"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Where-is-AV1-codec-used"><a href="#Where-is-AV1-codec-used" class="headerlink" title="Where is AV1 codec used?"></a>Where is AV1 codec used?</h3><p>The AV1 codec is offered on a license-free basis to any interested user. Furthermore, the AOMedia patent license is fully compliant with the W3C Patent Policy, meaning you will not face any legal ramifications if you use the technology. As such, you will find the technology available on non-AOMedia member devices. For example, Broadcom offers AV1 codec support on its BCM 72190 and 72180 chipsets for Android TVs.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://order.glarysoft.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=35408920&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/6734fa703f6633ab896eecbdfad8953a/products/FR-200-1.png"                      border="0"                >Glarysoft File Recovery Pro - Helps to recover your lost file&#x2F;data, even permanently deleted data. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part2-What-are-the-best-video-editors-to-edit-an-AV1-format-video"><a href="#Part2-What-are-the-best-video-editors-to-edit-an-AV1-format-video" class="headerlink" title="Part2: What are the best video editors to edit an AV1 format video?"></a>Part2: What are the best video editors to edit an AV1 format video?</h2><p>Now that you know what AV1 is, what are the best video editors to edit an AV1 format video?

However, it applies the AV1 codec on videos with over 1 million likes as part of its codec testing.</p><ul><li><a href="#part2-1">Avidemux</a></li><li><a href="#part2-2">Lightworks</a></li><li><a href="#part2-3">Filmora Video Editor</a></li><li><a href="#part2-4">Movavi Video Editor</a></li><li><a href="#part2-5">VirtualDub</a></li><li><a href="#part3">FAQ</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part1-What-is-the-av01-codec-1"><a href="#Part1-What-is-the-av01-codec-1" class="headerlink" title="Part1: What is the av01 codec?"></a>Part1: What is the av01 codec?</h2><p>Initially, companies relied on proprietary technology to provide you with video content. For example, most video providers were using variants of MPEG codecs to edit their online content, with others preferring  for 4K content. However, using this method proved expensive and meant that some companies were missing out on the lucrative video streaming market.</p><p>As such, the Alliance for Open Media was formed in 2015 to develop an open-source, royalty-free video codec to outperform all previous versions. Through this collaboration, the Aomedia Video 1 (AV1) codec came to be. Here are some questions to help you understand the technology much better.</p><h3 id="What-is-a-codec-and-what-is-the-AV01-codec-1"><a href="#What-is-a-codec-and-what-is-the-AV01-codec-1" class="headerlink" title="What is a codec, and what is the AV01 codec?"></a>What is a codec, and what is the AV01 codec?</h3><p>A codec is a type of compression technology that consists of two parts:</p><ul><li>An encoder compresses the original file to smaller sizes that you can share through the internet or other portable storage.</li><li>A decoder to decompress the file to its original format.</li></ul><p>In addition, you can use different types of codecs depending on the file format. For example, MPEG codecs were the preferred choice for video files. However, streaming companies now use codec AV1 for their content. This is because it offers faster compression times and smaller files than other previous video codecs.</p><h3 id="Is-it-popular-1"><a href="#Is-it-popular-1" class="headerlink" title="Is it popular?"></a>Is it popular?</h3><p>Yes, it is. Since its introduction in May 2018, more companies have been integrating the codec in their offerings. Here is a list of companies that offer AV1 codec support:</p><ul><li>Google offers AV1 codec support for Chrome web browser and all Android 10+ smart devices, including your mobile and smart TV. In addition, you can also video chat on Google Duo using the AV1 codec.</li><li>Microsoft also offers AV1 codec support for their Edge browser.</li><li>Other companies that offer codec AV1 support with their software include Opera, Mozilla Firefox, VLC Media Player, and Vivaldi.</li><li>Samsung and LG support 8K streaming on their Q950TS and ZX-OLED TVs, respectively.</li><li>Intel and NVIDIA also offer HD AV1 support with their graphics processing units.</li><li>Additionally, video content providers such as Amazon, Netflix, and YouTube offer AV01 codec support through their devices and online platforms.</li><li>Following successful tests in 2018, Facebook now uses the AV1 codec for videos on the platform.</li></ul><h3 id="Where-is-AV1-codec-used-1"><a href="#Where-is-AV1-codec-used-1" class="headerlink" title="Where is AV1 codec used?"></a>Where is AV1 codec used?</h3><p>The AV1 codec is offered on a license-free basis to any interested user. Furthermore, the AOMedia patent license is fully compliant with the W3C Patent Policy, meaning you will not face any legal ramifications if you use the technology. As such, you will find the technology available on non-AOMedia member devices. For example, Broadcom offers AV1 codec support on its BCM 72190 and 72180 chipsets for Android TVs.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=2337838&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><iframe width="640" height="390" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rzZwphIv4RM" title="APFill - Ink and Toner Coverage Calculator" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part2-What-are-the-best-video-editors-to-edit-an-AV1-format-video-1"><a href="#Part2-What-are-the-best-video-editors-to-edit-an-AV1-format-video-1" class="headerlink" title="Part2: What are the best video editors to edit an AV1 format video?"></a>Part2: What are the best video editors to edit an AV1 format video?</h2><p>Now that you know what AV1 is, what are the best video editors to edit an AV1 format video?

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="From-Concept-to-Reality-Selecting-Top-3D-Animators’-Software"><a href="#From-Concept-to-Reality-Selecting-Top-3D-Animators’-Software" class="headerlink" title="From Concept to Reality: Selecting Top 3D Animators’ Software"></a>From Concept to Reality: Selecting Top 3D Animators’ Software</h2><p>Using software like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for editing your videos ready for uploading or release is fast and effective but first you have to get your files ready to import. We will be talking about 3d model creation today which is the first step in 3D animation creation. There are many options out there with their own advantages and drawbacks as well as price points and additional support via tutorials and in some cases assets to help speed up the creation process.</p><p>In every case you can always just buy ready-made models for your animations but in doing that you lose the option and the flexibility to have a completely custom asset with the ability to alter when needed.</p><p>There are many steps to creating that perfect video and in time you will have your preferred method. We call this our workflow. Achieving a comfortable workflow is one of the most important and influential processes you will undergo as a creative artist, this is due to the fact even with the best ideas and all the drive in the world, if you struggle to translate that into a 3d model then it stays in your head and no one will see it.</p><p>With this in mind let’s look at some of the options available to us and how we can use them for this first most important step in our creative process. Remember to pick one that does not limit your creativity and gives you the tools you need to translate thought into visualization.</p><h2 id="ZBrush-by-MAXON"><a href="#ZBrush-by-MAXON" class="headerlink" title="ZBrush by MAXON"></a>ZBrush by MAXON</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/zbrush-by-maxon.jpg"                      alt="zbrush by maxon"                ></p><p>Zbrush is what is considered an industry standard 3D modeling software and is one of the most used by many leading studios. This is a paid software with different versions meeting different needs depending on what you feel you need. You can create impressive 3d models with very high levels of detail without overusing your computer resources resulting in a stable and fluid working process. Zbrush is very powerful with many features, too many features to highlight in this guide but as an overview some features that can improve your process are:</p><ul><li>You can import or create alphas easily for micro detailing.</li><li>There is a live boolean to create unique items within your sculpts.</li><li>It’s very easy to use the Zremesher to create a new clean topology of your sculptures.<br> Dynamesh lets you work and retopo as you go so the sculpt retains detail.</li><li>Work with multiple levels of divisions at the same time with the Sub Divide tools.</li></ul><p>This is just a tiny scratch on the surface of what ZBrush can do. There are all the tools you need within this software to create an amazing jaw dropping model for your videos but this is a paid software which is important to remember when making the decision to go with this one as you will need animation and rigging software as well as in some cases a UV editor. Another thing to remember is system requirements depending on your setup. Minimum system requirements are as follows:</p><p><strong>For Windows:</strong></p><ul><li>64-bit Windows 10 or 11 .</li><li>Core 2 Duo or AMD equivalent with SSE2 technology or better.</li><li>4GB of ram with a strong recommendation for 6GB or more.</li><li>8GB of free hard drive space.</li><li>A graphics card with OpenGL 3.3 or higher and Vulkan 1.1 or higher.</li><li>Monitor with 32-bit color and a resolution of 1280x1024.</li><li>Mouse or Wacom compatible (WinTab API) pen tablet.</li></ul><p><strong>For Mac:</strong></p><ul><li>Mac OSX: 10.14 or above</li><li>Everything else is the same as above.</li></ul><p>Zbrush runs the same on Windows and Mac so there is no advantage over the other and the only real elements that you need to consider is your CPU and your RAM, A faster CPU with more cores will make this program run more stable and 16GB or RAM or more will also help with stability so if your running an older computer this will still work but you may be limited to pixel count but that is true for all 3D creation software.</p><h2 id="Autodesk-Maya"><a href="#Autodesk-Maya" class="headerlink" title="Autodesk Maya"></a>Autodesk Maya</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/autodesk-maya.jpg"                      alt="autodesk maya"                ></p><p>This guide wouldn’t be complete without introducing Maya, Maya is another industry standard for modeling but also offers animation and rigging tools meaning this covers a lot more ground that some of the other 3D modeling software.</p><p>Maya is very powerful but for this guide I will only be talking about the 3D modeling creation tools as I feel other topics need their own space but that said I think it is important to mention this is a complete workflow from creation to the exportation of your movie file into Filmora ready for editing and uploading to your audience.</p><p>Again this software has a list of features that is simply too large to cover so i will highlight some useful features for your creative process.</p><ul><li>Polygon modeling lets you create 3D models based on vertexes, edges and faces.</li><li>Nurbs modeling lets you create 3d models from geometric primitives and drawn curves</li><li>Sculpting tools allows you to create organic sculpts</li><li>Subdivision workflow for better performance in higher pixel counts</li><li>Built in UV editing</li><li>Orthopedic viewport so you can check dimensions from whichever side you need</li></ul><p>Again we are only scratching the surface of what Maya can do. Maya is capable of creating hyper realistic hard surface and organic models for use within animation and also provides all the tools needed to get a perfect rendering. Again system performance is important to consider when choosing software and the minimum requirements are as follows:</p><ul><li>Windows 10 or 11, macOS x or above and linux but see website for compatibility.</li><li>64-bit Intel or AMD multi-core processor with SSE4.2, M series Mac under rosetta 2.</li><li>8GB of RAM but 16GB or more is recommended.</li><li>7GB free disk space for the install.</li><li>Three-button mouse.</li><li>Graphics card please see website for compatibility</li></ul><p>This is a paid software and can be expensive so please consider this when choosing your desired workflow but also consider that this is a complete workflow right up to importing your video file into Filmora so the price may be justified compared to multiple software. Another thing to consider is you can mostly get the desired results you want without the use of a drawing tablet cutting even more cost.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075461/7443" target="_top" id="2075461"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075461"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075461/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3DCoat-2022"><a href="#3DCoat-2022" class="headerlink" title="3DCoat 2022"></a>3DCoat 2022</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/3-coat-2022.jpg"                      alt="3 coat 2022"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=30901410&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/ce9a6fb2becc2d235e62b125e9260102/products/copy_1_copy_vMixCallScreenshot1-large.jpg"                      border="0"                > vMix Pro - Software based live production. vMix Pro includes everything in vMix 4K plus 8 channels of Replay and 8 vMix Call<br>This bundle includes Studio 200 for vMix from Virtualsetworks, HTTP Matrix 1.0 automation scheduler, and 4 introductory training videos from the Udemy vMix Basic to Amazing course. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>3DCoat was first released in 2007 and has released constant updates inline with the 3D art community needs. Being a smaller team of developers it’s quite impressive what they have achieved as this is a fully featured 3D art software capable of creating very nice detailed models. When used with the likes of Daz 3D, Keyshot or similar animation software you can easily create the animation you are planning. This is not a full workflow but it is very close to one and the team are constantly releasing updates so one day it might be. You have the ability to UV your models as well as texture, paint and sculpt all within one program and this has one of the most impressive live retopo tools around called voxel modeling mode. Key features are as follows:</p><ul><li>Easy texturing and PBR with the use of smart materials and a HDRL viewport.</li><li>Voxel sculpting with complex boolean operations and adaptive dynamic tessellation.</li><li>Classic polygonal modeling is fully supported and also supports splines and joints.</li><li>Auto-retopology with user-defined edge loops but also fast and easy manual tools.</li><li>Professional tools for creating and editing UV-sets.</li><li>Native global uniform unwrapping algorithms.</li><li>PBR and HDRL rendering for concept exporting.</li><li>Use of scripts for repetitive actions.</li><li>And many more.</li></ul><p>This is paid software but with many options to buy as well as unlimited learning period which you will have to take into consideration when you are deciding to take this in your workflow. And again another consideration is your hardware and 3DCoat is complex due to the complexity of their software , as a point of reference there website states they consider a Surface Pro as the minimal hardware needed to use there software, minimum system specs are as follows:</p><ul><li>64-Bit Windows 7&#x2F;8&#x2F;10&#x2F;11, macOS 10.13 High Sierra or higher, Linux Ubuntu 20.04+</li><li>CPU m3 1.00 GHz,</li><li>4GB RAM</li><li>Intel HD Graphics 615</li><li>This will allow painting textures up to 2K and sculpting up to 1 million triangles</li></ul><p>What makes 3DCoat a good choice is the fact they have unlimited learning allowing you to journey into sculpting without putting any money in to start and in confection with other software it is very powerful.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2095385/26400" target="_top" id="2095385"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2095385"                      border="0" alt="" width="1024" height="1024"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2095385/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Blender"><a href="#Blender" class="headerlink" title="Blender"></a>Blender</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/blender-modeling-software.jpg"                      alt="blender modeling software"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://arkmc.pxf.io/c/5597632/427477/5172" target="_top" id="427477"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/5172-427477"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://arkmc.pxf.io/i/5597632/427477/5172"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>So now it’s time to talk about Blender, the Blender institute set off with one main goal in mind and that was to put powerful tools for use with 3D and CG in the hands of artists in the form of free&#x2F;open-source software. This is commendable and they have in large achieved what they set out to do, not only can you sculpt or model in Blender you can also rig and animate and add VFX to your projects.</p><p>It’s impressive to see what you can do with free software and you will be able to achieve very good results. What you miss out on in the form of automation tools and boutique brushes and toolsets this makes up for in an ever-expanding community driven tutorials and guides. With this being free it doesn’t make sense to not have this installed even if you have a different workflow due to the ability to expand with new skills that may work their way into your daily task. Key features are as follows:</p><ul><li>Render with impressive results thanks to cycles,</li><li>An extensive toolset for modeling, curves and retopology</li><li>Sculpting tools provide the power and flexibility needed in several stages of production</li><li>Designed for animation in mind</li><li>Push the boundaries of story art by drawing in a 3d environment</li><li>Powerful post FX and VFX tools like object motion tracking</li><li>Fully customisable UI and controles</li><li>Python API means every tool can be customized and scripted</li></ul><p>Blender is complex software and due to this some functions require different hardware specs but as a rule the higher the CPU speed and cores plus the more RAM you have the more you can do at any given time. With this said the minimum system requirements are as follows@</p><ul><li>Windows 8.1,10 and 11, macOS 10.13 and above and Linux supported</li><li>64-Bit quad core CPU with SSE2 support</li><li>8GB RAM</li><li>Full HD display</li><li>Mouse, trackpad or pen+tablet</li><li>Graphics card with 2GB VRAM, OpenGL 4.3 support</li></ul><p>Blender receives regular updates and is supported by community scripts and content and is becoming a new go to tool for 3D artists in all industries and backgrounds making it a real contender when picking a workflow.</p><p><strong>From Desktop to Portable</strong></p><p>There are lots of options and this list is in no way stating what you may already use is not good enough, this is just what is being used in the industry and is more accessible to a starter or someone who works from home and doesn’t want to spend thousands upfront for their software.</p><p>That being said there is more than just the desktop workflow and some people lead busy lifestyles and are always on the move. This is where I would like to introduce the portable workflow. Due to the fact the Ipad Pro is considered a must have for portable creativity and with recent releases there has never been a better time to start i will be showing Ipad compatible apps.</p><h2 id="Forger-by-Maxon"><a href="#Forger-by-Maxon" class="headerlink" title="Forger by Maxon"></a>Forger by Maxon</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/forger-by-maxon.jpg"                      alt="forger by maxon"                ></p><p>Forger is released as a standalone app or part of the Maxon one. Forger gives you all the tools needed to create sculptures and models on the go which you can be proud of. Designed by artists for artists the features are quite large considering this is running on an ipad and with the seamlessness of importing and exporting to and from software such as cinema 4D this can be worked into your workflow very easily. One feature of Forger that people like to talk about is the ability to use your ipad camera and view your model in the real world using augmented reality.</p><p>Some of the key features of Forger but not limited to are as follows:</p><ul><li>Multi-resolution mesh sculpting via catmull0clark mesh subdivisions.</li><li>Volume-based quad-dominant remeshing.</li><li>Sculpt in layers.</li><li>Sculpt with a mask with the ability to clear, invert, blur, grow and shrink your masks.</li><li>Ability to close holes in existing meshes</li><li>Simple auto-generation of mesh UVs.</li><li>Symmetrical sculpting based on axis of choice</li><li>Ability to reapply symmetry to topologically symmetrical meshes.</li></ul><p>Forger is very powerful and don’t let the fact it’s on an ipad make you think it’s inferior to the bigger desktop software as this is very capable of getting the results you are looking for. It just takes a bit of researching and a different learning curve. Due to the fact it is on an ipad the system requirements are easier to achieve, minimum system requirements are as follows</p><ul><li>IOS 15 or later</li><li>Ipad pro or current model ipad</li></ul><p>A note from the developers, the more complex the model being sculpted, the more RAM required. While there is no screen size requirement, as anticipated the bigger the better when it comes to sculpting workspace.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1657399/16446" target="_top" id="1657399"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1657399"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1657399/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Nomad-Sculpt"><a href="#Nomad-Sculpt" class="headerlink" title="Nomad Sculpt"></a>Nomad Sculpt</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/nomad-sculpt-software.jpg"                      alt="nomad sculpt software"                ></p><p>Nomad Sculpt is another contender offering powerful tools that artists can use to sculpt outstanding models for your animations.

This is a very cool feature as you can paint on different maps directly onto your model and get the exact results you wanted, the prerequisite for this is your OBJ needs to have UV’s already applied when you import into procreate and also this is limited to only three maps as of writing this, they have started they are going to advancing this feature in upcoming updates. Procreate also allows you to use augmented reality to view your models in the real world.

Now, it depends on the track and its nature and how it does it work on the video and audience. You should choose one option carefully. In case you want to add a quick effect of fade out and in, you should consider constant gain. The use of constant power will allow you to get a transition between both tracks without any gap or space lack. For slow fade out and in effects, you can go with the option of exponential fade. All these options will help you work out properly and make things much easier.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Fade-Out-Music-By-Changing-Music-Duration"><a href="#Part-2-Fade-Out-Music-By-Changing-Music-Duration" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Fade Out Music By Changing Music Duration"></a>Part 2 Fade Out Music By Changing Music Duration</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/fade-out-music-pr-4.png"                      alt="Fade out by changing music duration "                ></p><p>Every time you may not feel the requirements of fade out and in settings of easy musical transition.

It helps in making the audial join smooth and avoids rough ends or disturbance in the output. Most commonly, fade effects are considered by professionals. In case you are using Premiere Pro and thinking of using the crossfade audio transition, you will have three options, such as –</p><p>● Constant power</p><p>● Constant gain</p><p>● Exponential fade</p><p>All these three options are leading to different effects. Now, it depends on the track and its nature and how it does it work on the video and audience. You should choose one option carefully. In case you want to add a quick effect of fade out and in, you should consider constant gain. The use of constant power will allow you to get a transition between both tracks without any gap or space lack. For slow fade out and in effects, you can go with the option of exponential fade. All these options will help you work out properly and make things much easier.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Fade-Out-Music-By-Changing-Music-Duration-1"><a href="#Part-2-Fade-Out-Music-By-Changing-Music-Duration-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Fade Out Music By Changing Music Duration"></a>Part 2 Fade Out Music By Changing Music Duration</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/fade-out-music-pr-4.png"                      alt="Fade out by changing music duration "                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://versadesk.pxf.io/c/5597632/1892108/21290" target="_top" id="1892108"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21290-1892108"                      border="0" alt="" width="1080" height="1080"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1892108/21290"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Every time you may not feel the requirements of fade out and in settings of easy musical transition.

The elements of drama are defined as the “key ingredients” of drama in the Arts in New Zealand Curriculum.</p><p>Radio drama contains the same elements as stage drama:</p><ul><li><strong>Role:</strong> characters in the game</li><li><strong>Time:</strong> when the event takes place</li><li><strong>Place:</strong> where the action takes place</li><li><strong>Action:</strong> what happens in the drama?</li><li><strong>Tension:</strong> conflict between characters and their surroundings</li><li><strong>Focus:</strong> the thoughts, feelings, or characters the playwright wants us to focus on at a particular moment.</li></ul><p>In radio drama, however, the playwright must inform us of the elements through various means, because we cannot get the information with our eyes. Radio drama is essentially heard, not seen.</p><h3 id="3-Radio-drama-features"><a href="#3-Radio-drama-features" class="headerlink" title="3. Radio drama features"></a>3. Radio drama features</h3><p><strong>The following are Radio Drama Features:</strong></p><ul><li>Radio drama uses sound to convey ideas to the audience. Audio can be in the form of dialogue, sound effects, or music.</li><li>Actors can play more than one role from moment to moment because only the voice needs to be changed.</li><li>Actors only use voice to express a character. They don’t need to use action, gestures, or facial expressions because the audience can’t see them.</li><li>There is no need for blocking or stage business in radio drama. However, actors may need to plan their movement to and from the microphone.</li><li>Radio playback can be set almost anywhere. There are no physical limits to overcome. Settings can easily be created with music and sound effects.</li><li>Radio drama contains a lot of dialogue. Since we can’t see what the actors are doing, they have to tell us what’s going on. The writer has to find ways for the characters to comment on where they are and what they and others are doing.</li><li>Radio scenes are often shorter than stage plays.</li><li>Radio drama must not be “live” in front of an audience. Radio drama is usually recorded and played back to an audience at a different time. This means that, just like in a movie, scenes don’t have to be played back-to-back and can be played more than once to get the best shot if needed. Drama can also be edited, and audio added.</li><li>Actors do not need to learn their lines. The actors can read their lines from the script because the audience can’t see it. Actors must be familiar with their lines and rehearsed how they will use their voice to tell the audience about the character and the action.</li><li>Radio drama usually features a small cast. A small number of characters are used in each scene because it is too difficult for the audience to distinguish between voices if there are many characters. The audience can also forget that a character is “on stage” if they don’t speak for a while because they can’t be seen. Because of this, the characters must speak quite often and be involved in the plot.</li><li>Radio drama is well suited for monologue and for plays where the setting is limited and physical action is not important, such as in a prison cell or cave.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.bitdefender.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=BITLATIN&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bitdefender.com%2Fbusiness%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D30%2525%2BOff%2Ball%2BGravityZone%2BProducts"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.bitdefender.com/content/dam/bitdefender/business/campaign/1200X628.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-3-tips-for-writing-radio-drama-scripts"><a href="#Part-2-3-tips-for-writing-radio-drama-scripts" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 3 tips for writing radio drama scripts"></a>Part 2. 3 tips for writing radio drama scripts</h2><p>Scriptwriting is a fundamental technique of creativity, whether for content production, copywriting, or art direction. Florida International University offers the Master of Science Creative Track in collaboration with the world-renowned portfolio school Miami Ad School. If you want to become a copywriter, the program is designed to hone your writing skills for a variety of communication styles and media, such as writing for video and audio content, TV and radio commercials, and the web.</p><p>Here are some tips to become a better audio-only content writer.</p><p>Writing a script allows you to control the content, structure, and flow of the program. If the show is unscripted and organic, the host will have talking points for reference. In addition to the script, you can also play with music and sound effects.</p><h3 id="1-Keep-your-scripts-clear"><a href="#1-Keep-your-scripts-clear" class="headerlink" title="1. Keep your scripts clear"></a>1. Keep your scripts clear</h3><p>Write the script while keeping it as simple as possible. Don’t fill your sentences with words that don’t add to what you’re trying to say.</p><p>Reading from a script can make you sound a little unnatural, as well as stiff and robotic. That is a huge error. When read aloud, the script should sound natural. A more formal approach and style can result in a show that sounds unnatural and is boring.</p><p>Radio has long been a popular form of entertainment, and radio dramas or plays are an excellent way for writers to express themselves. Original stories or adaptations of novels or plays can be used in radio dramas. Radio plays, like stage plays, have scenes, sequences, and acts, but they are not always structured the same way. Radio drama allows for a great deal of flexibility and creativity, and the medium of sound is also unique.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/radio-drama-scripts-2.jpg"                      alt="keep your scripts clear"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://turtlebeachus.sjv.io/c/5597632/1988416/23719" target="_top" id="1988416"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/23719-1988416"                      border="0" alt="" width="600" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1988416/23719"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Novelists and screenwriters will need to alter their writing style to write for the ear rather than the eye. Listeners cannot read the previous line or skip ahead. Everything must make sense and be visualized by the listener at that time. To convey action and drama, use dialogue, sound effects, music, and even silence. This can be completed by including specific audio cues in your script so that the show’s creators understand your vision. Keep the script as brief as possible. There can never be too much prose or long-winded dialogue in radio plays. Everything must be brief, succinct, and to the point.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068407/7443" target="_top" id="2068407"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068407"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068407/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-Jump-right-into-the-action"><a href="#2-Jump-right-into-the-action" class="headerlink" title="2. Jump right into the action"></a>2. Jump right into the action</h3><p>Radio drama can be more difficult because it must immediately engage listeners, or they will lose interest and switch stations or channels. The first two minutes are crucial, so start your drama at the appropriate point in the story. The rule of thumb in the radio industry is ‘arrive late, leave early.’ This means you should enter the story at a later stage when the action has begun or when a crisis has occurred. Unlike books and movies, setting, building, and background details are not required. You can save the necessary details for later in the play.</p><p>Radio scripts, like scripts, must conform to industry standards for radio program producers to find the script usable. Include scripts for music, sound effects, silence, dialogue, and other audio needs in the game so that producers can see how the script will translate into the show. Include information for the actors as well, so they can bring your vision to life. For example, use adjectives to describe how they should sound when reading their lines - sad, angry, laughing, and so on. Also, keep the number of characters to a minimum and give each one a distinct voice and style.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/radio-drama-scripts-3.jpg"                      alt="jump right into the action"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.movavi.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=MOVAVI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.movavi.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3DMovavi%2BVideo%2BEditor%2Bbox"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://mcusercontent.com/0885a03ded3d480dca9287f12/images/6d3207fd-9f15-4c21-f0ad-59c68e6a7e2a.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.manycam.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=17728032&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/8230bea7d54bcdf99cdfe85cb07313d5/mcaffbanner920x120.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-Make-It-Sound-Conversational"><a href="#3-Make-It-Sound-Conversational" class="headerlink" title="3.

Simply refer to the detailed instructions provided below to understand how to zoom in and out in Roblox.</p><h2 id="Way-1-Zoom-In-Out-with-Keyboard-Shortcut"><a href="#Way-1-Zoom-In-Out-with-Keyboard-Shortcut" class="headerlink" title="Way 1. Zoom In&#x2F;Out with Keyboard Shortcut"></a>Way 1. Zoom In&#x2F;Out with Keyboard Shortcut</h2><p>You’ve been looking at your screen nonstop, but you can’t figure out what it says. You could find the answer you’re searching for by zooming in on your computer. The majority of simple tasks may be performed with the keyboard, such as moving an item using the W, A, S, and D keys, but you can rotate the environment or zoom in and out using the trackpad. By the way, you may move the game’s camera by using the navigation buttons. For instance, in the Roblox game, the numerical keys on the keyboard may be used to modify the objects’ seating positions as well as the weapons and equipment they are carrying. And don’t worry, zooming in and out is not a difficult task. You really have a wide variety of methods to zoom in and out of your Roblox PC depending on your preferences.</p><p><strong>Steps to Zoom in on Roblox with Keyboard:</strong></p><p>Step1To start playing, you must first sign into Roblox using your browser. Go to the Roblox website in your favourite web browser by opening it. Start a testing game session after logging in.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/login-to-roblox-site.jpg"                      alt="login to roblox site"                ></p><p>Step2Now, all you have to do to zoom in is hit the ‘I’ key on your keyboard, which is located between the ‘U’ and ‘O’ keys.</p><p>Step3If you press or hold this, you’ll probably enter first-person perspective, where you can’t zoom in any more. If you’re already somewhat out of focus, however, you’ll first zoom in toward your character before entering first-person view.</p><p>Step4Simply press the ‘O’ key on your keyboard (the letter between ‘P’ and ‘I’ on a QWERTY keyboard) to zoom out. You may hit “O” as many as you wish or hold it down while you do so to increase the zoom to its highest setting.</p><p>Step5To get the playing zoom level you desire, press “I” and “O” together. You must consequently mix the actions of these two keyboard keys in order to zoom in at the most pleasing scale.</p><h2 id="Way-2-Zoom-In-Out-in-Roblox-with-Mouse-Control"><a href="#Way-2-Zoom-In-Out-in-Roblox-with-Mouse-Control" class="headerlink" title="Way 2. Zoom In&#x2F;Out in Roblox with Mouse Control"></a>Way 2. Zoom In&#x2F;Out in Roblox with Mouse Control</h2><p>With over half of all Roblox users being under the age of 16, it is likely that you already know the mouse zooming method. Roblox is one of the most well-known gaming and playing networks for youngsters. To move the camera in all directions, hold down the right mouse button or right mouse click. This control is available in all of Roblox’s games. If your mouse is compatible, you can enable Smart Zoom in the Mouse Preferences and zoom with only a single finger double-tap. You may choose other zoom settings, such as whether to zoom the whole screen or only a portion of it. But you must do certain actions in order to change the camera and mouse sensitivity.</p><p><strong>Steps to Zoom in on Roblox with Mouse</strong></p><p>Step1Go to the Roblox website in your favourite web browser by opening it. Start a testing game session after logging in.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/start-testing-game-session-roblox.jpg"                      alt="start testing game session roblox"                ></p><p>Step2Once your gaming session has begun, you may zoom by using the wheel while moving ahead. Once again, if you scroll all the way down, this action will put you in first person perspective. Now all you have to do is use your cursor to scroll ahead to zoom in.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/zoom-in-with-cursoe-scroll.jpg"                      alt="zoom in with cursoe scroll"                ></p><p>Step3When the game’s map is in your field of vision and you reach the maximum zoom level, just scroll backward with your mouse to zoom out. It will be essential to do the opposite operation, namely scroll the other direction, to zoom out on your character, in order to zoom in.</p><p>Step4In order to play at your selected zoom level, scroll backwards and forth. Because your character will be presented in such tiny type, it will be challenging to play comfortably and see it clearly. Therefore, maintaining balance is crucial in order to have the zoom adjusted to your preferred playing style.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.systoolsgroup.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=SYSTOOBY&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.systoolsgroup.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3DSysTools%2BOST%2BRecovery"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.systoolsgroup.com/box/ost-recovery.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Way-3-Use-Xbox-Controller-Thumbsticks-to-Zoom"><a href="#Way-3-Use-Xbox-Controller-Thumbsticks-to-Zoom" class="headerlink" title="Way 3. Use Xbox Controller Thumbsticks to Zoom"></a>Way 3. Use Xbox Controller Thumbsticks to Zoom</h2><p>The amount of mouse usage varies greatly depending on the kind of game being played, with racing games requiring the least amount of mouse use and first-person shooter games requiring the most. Nevertheless, there are several methods to play every game without a mouse. Since the Roblox platform makes it possible to create games, the game’s creator mostly determines the control parameters. In such scenario, you also need a trackpad since using the keyboard could prevent you from accessing some menu options. The good news for Xbox players is that you may do so by using the Thumb sticks.</p><p><strong>Steps to Zoom in on Roblox with Xbox Controller:</strong></p><p>Step1There is a simple and convenient technique to manage the zoom while playing Roblox on the Xbox. Push the R3 button on your controller, which corresponds to the right stick click, to enable the zoom feature. Additionally, you may depress the right thumbstick.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/push-r3-button-controller.jpg"                      alt="push r3 button ontroller"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4718728&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/ce9a6fb2becc2d235e62b125e9260102/products/vMixCallScreenshot1-large.jpg"                      border="0"                > vMix Basic HD - Software based live production. vMix Basic HD includes 4 inputs, 3 cameras, streaming, recording, playlist.<br>This bundle includes Studio 200 for vMix from Virtualsetworks, HTTP Matrix 1.0 automation scheduler, and 4 introductory training videos from the Udemy vMix Basic to Amazing course. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Step2Zoom in by pressing forward on the right thumbstick that has been clicked down.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/press-forward-right-thumbstick.jpg"                      alt="press forward right thumbstick"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://order.glarysoft.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=35408920&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/6734fa703f6633ab896eecbdfad8953a/products/FR-200-1.png"                      border="0"                >Glarysoft File Recovery Pro - Helps to recover your lost file&#x2F;data, even permanently deleted data. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Step3Pull rearward on the clicked-down right thumbstick to zoom out.

With Smart HDR features, your camera will take buffer frames,</p><ul><li>where you’ll need to tap the shutter before and after, that capture images in different exposures so that your iPhone will capture everything, even highlights, shadows, and background objects.</li><li>Newer models of iPhone, equipped with Apple’s A12 Bionic chip, have Smart HDR, which automatically adjusts the dynamic range by employing AI technology.</li><li>If you’re looking to use HDR for any type of photo, use your photos with a significant amount of high contrast with dramatic, meaningful light or shadow contrast and be sure to keep your camera as steady as possible to get the best results.</li><li>Smart HDR can vastly improve your photos without you doing anything different.</li><li>It seems to use both an image sensor and a depth map from its TrueDepth camera setup.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/what-are-auto-hdr-smart-hdr-3-and-4-shooting-modes-4.jpg"                      alt="smart hdr"                ></p><h3 id="Auto-HDR-iPhone-X"><a href="#Auto-HDR-iPhone-X" class="headerlink" title="Auto HDR (iPhone X)"></a>Auto HDR (iPhone X)</h3><p>Auto HDR is a feature in the camera of the iPhone X series that takes multiple pictures at different exposures and then combines them to create one well-exposed photo. One of the things that make the iPhone camera so great is computational photography.</p><p>This feature is designed to improve the quality of your photos by automatically applying a high dynamic range (HDR) effect. Here are five benefits of using Auto HDR on your iPhone</p><ul><li>You can avoid editing your photos in post-processing, which saves time and reduces the risk of errors;</li><li>Auto HDR applies different levels of saturation and contrast depending on what you’re photographing, giving you more accurate colors;</li><li>It uses face detection to properly expose portraits; -</li><li>It improves details in low light situations; and</li><li>It’s enabled by default in iOS 11 so you don’t have to do anything.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/what-are-auto-hdr-smart-hdr-3-and-4-shooting-modes-5.jpg"                      alt="auto hdr"                ></p><h2 id="Should-you-Lookout-for-the-HDR-feature-on-iPhone-14"><a href="#Should-you-Lookout-for-the-HDR-feature-on-iPhone-14" class="headerlink" title="Should you Lookout for the HDR feature on iPhone 14?"></a>Should you Lookout for the HDR feature on iPhone 14?</h2><p>The rumor mill is generating leaks about a possible new 48 MP main sensor for the next-generation iPhone 14 Pro camera. Some features of this camera may include more-realistic colors and better low-light performance in addition to all of the other specs we have been hearing about recently.</p><p>If these rumors prove true, it’s possible that Apple will introduce an even more robust and efficient HDR system than what we see on iPhones today.</p><ul><li>iPhone 14 camera will come with a 48 Megapixel sensor. It is rumored that there would be more-realistic colors and better low light performance too.</li><li>8K video recording is a simple resolution bump for the Pro models. For example, if you record a 4K video at 30 frames per second (fps), then your videos playback at 15 fps when played back on an iPhone.</li><li>The selfie cameras of the iPhone 14 models will also receive a major upgrade. The new front-facing sensors are said to offer three times as many pixels. These pixels should help keep faces from looking distorted or pixilated while maintaining natural skin tones.</li></ul><h2 id="Final-words"><a href="#Final-words" class="headerlink" title="Final words"></a>Final words</h2><p>Computational photography is a technique that takes advantage of the impressive processing power of modern smartphones to create stunning and persuasive pictures. The most common examples of this are the Auto HDR and Smart HDR modes found on many iPhones.</p><p>These modes use computational photography to automatically improve the dynamic range and color of your photos, making them look much better than they would with traditional camera techniques.</p><p>Auto HDR will make sure both shadows and highlights are in focus, while Smart HDR 3 or 4 take it one step further by creating a high-dynamic-range image from three or four exposures.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p>What is the HDR Feature for iPhone Photos?</p><p>HDR is a feature that allows you to take better photos in low-light situations and at night.

It is rumored that there would be more-realistic colors and better low light performance too.</li><li>8K video recording is a simple resolution bump for the Pro models. For example, if you record a 4K video at 30 frames per second (fps), then your videos playback at 15 fps when played back on an iPhone.</li><li>The selfie cameras of the iPhone 14 models will also receive a major upgrade. The new front-facing sensors are said to offer three times as many pixels. These pixels should help keep faces from looking distorted or pixilated while maintaining natural skin tones.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://vapordna.pxf.io/c/5597632/1494880/17238" target="_top" id="1494880"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17238-1494880"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1494880/17238"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Final-words-1"><a href="#Final-words-1" class="headerlink" title="Final words"></a>Final words</h2><p>Computational photography is a technique that takes advantage of the impressive processing power of modern smartphones to create stunning and persuasive pictures.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="An-In-Depth-Look-at-Basic-and-Simplified-HDR-Photography"><a href="#An-In-Depth-Look-at-Basic-and-Simplified-HDR-Photography" class="headerlink" title="An In-Depth Look at Basic and Simplified HDR Photography"></a>An In-Depth Look at Basic and Simplified HDR Photography</h2><p>Any professional photographer knows that “photography” is a broad niche. For example, HDR photography involves taking images in dark and bright areas. But because these images might not show much to the naked eyes, you’ll need an HDR program like <strong>EasyHDR</strong>. This software can recreate and design incredible HDR photos on Mac and Windows computers. So, this review post advises you whether <strong>Easy HDR</strong> is worth the money or not. We’ll also advise on the best way to edit and create HDR videos on PC.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Summary-Box-on-Easy-HDR"><a href="#Part-1-Summary-Box-on-Easy-HDR" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Summary Box on Easy HDR"></a>Part 1: Summary Box on Easy HDR</h2><table><thead><tr><th>Description</th><th>EasyHDR is an HDR photography software for highlighting image details in HDR photos. It supports raw images and batch processing.</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Pricing</td><td>$33 for a lifetime license</td></tr><tr><td>Operating System</td><td>Windows 7&#x2F;8&#x2F;10&#x2F;11 and macOS 10.12 or newer</td></tr><tr><td>Layout</td><td>4.5&#x2F;5</td></tr><tr><td>Easy to use</td><td>4.8&#x2F;5</td></tr><tr><td>HDQ quality</td><td>4.2&#x2F;5</td></tr><tr><td>Post-processing</td><td>3.5&#x2F;5</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Before we dive deeper into this <strong>Easy HDRi</strong> review, let’s first discuss how this HDR software rates in some critical aspects:</p><ol><li><strong>Effectiveness – 4.8&#x2F;5</strong></li></ol><p>The HDRi process on this software is very effective, although you shouldn’t have high expectations. It provides manual and automatic lens correction properties, although using the manual option might need a learning curve. Other extras include ghost removal and automatic alignment.</p><ol><li><strong>Price – 4.7&#x2F;5</strong></li></ol><p>Easy HDR is not necessarily a free program. Although there’s a free demo version, it’s pretty limited in features. Therefore, purchase the premium plan for $33 or $55 for personal and lifetime licenses. As a seasoned HDR editor, you should know that other HDR programs like Aurora HDR cost way more than this.</p><ol><li><strong>Supported OS – 5&#x2F;5</strong></li></ol><p>This HDR photography program is compatible with Windows and macOS systems, which is a big plus. You can install it on Windows 7 or newer and macOS 10.12 or newer. Sorry, Linux users!</p><ol><li><strong>Ease of use – 4.8</strong></li></ol><p>Easy HDR is one of the most beginner-friendly HDR processing tools despite the advanced management tools. It features automatic lens correction, ghost removal, and HDR merging capabilities.</p><ol><li><strong>Best for – Beginner HDRi editors</strong></li></ol><p>This program’s simple approach makes it perfect for HDRi photographers without prior editing skills. Also, if you’re a beginner on a tight budget, easyHDR is the best software for you.</p><p><strong>Our Verdict</strong></p><p>Up to this juncture, you might wonder if Easy HDR is worth the money or not. Well, that depends on what you want. If you have minimal HDR editing knowledge, then this is the best professional program for you.</p><p>The straightforward layout boasts automatic HDR editing tools to make your work effortless. In addition, it supports a wide array of image formats, including photos taken using your DSLR camera. And the $33&#x2F;lifetime price should be manageable by many average Joes.</p><p>But on the flip side, Easy HDR lacks in-depth post-processing tools. Also, it lacks the all-important “undo” feature, which is vital in HDR image editing. Other than that, it’s the perfect program to make dramatic and realistic HDR photos.</p><p>Pros</p><ul><li>Simple layout.</li><li>Make realistic HDR images with automatic tools.</li><li>Easy HDRi Blender and Adobe Lightroom plugins.</li><li>Standalone Easy HDR desktop program.</li><li>Batch processing supported.</li><li>Compatible with multiple image formats, including RAW.</li></ul><p>Cons</p><ul><li>It doesn’t have advanced HDR post-processing tools.</li><li>No HDR feature for editing.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Detailed-Review-for-Easy-HDR"><a href="#Part-2-Detailed-Review-for-Easy-HDR" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Detailed Review for Easy HDR"></a>Part 2. Detailed Review for Easy HDR</h2><p>Before diving deeper into the detailed Easy HDR features, it’s important to note that the program has a demo version. You can use this version to practice and study the vital components of easyHDR. But be guided that the demo version exports images with a watermark. In addition, users can’t save HDRi in TIFF format. Let’s get in!</p><ol><li><strong>High-Quality Bracket Merging</strong></li></ol><p>A good quality HDRi software should easily merge different image exposures, making the photo look natural and spectacular. To start incorporating, drag the image brackets to easyHDR and press “Ok” on the pop-up screen. You can now try the different bracket merging effects until you find something that suits your preference.</p><ol><li><strong>Editing features</strong></li></ol><p>EasyHDR goes a step further to provide its users with a comprehensive list of editing features. For example, the “Clone Stamp” tool can remove unwanted objects like cables without blurring the photo. You can also use the “Tone Curve” feature to adjust the brightness of shadows and highlights.</p><ol><li><strong>Ghost removal</strong></li></ol><p>No, this is not the scary ghost that you know. Instead, these ghosting artefacts appear in misaligned photos due to moving objects like leaves, branches, cars, people, etc. With Easy HDR, you can eliminate the “ghosts” manually or automatically. Simply open the photo and turn on “Ghost Removal” to remove them automatically.</p><ol><li><strong>HDR batch processing</strong></li></ol><p>As expected, you can find it pretty tedious to import and merge each HDR bracket individually. For this reason, easyHDR comes with a “Batch Processing” feature that allows users to combine a whole folder of brackets automatically.</p><ol><li><strong>LDR enhancement</strong></li></ol><p>Although we’ve mainly focused on brackets and photos in this post, it’s important to note that easyHDR also works with single images. Instead of having three separate bracketed exposures, LDR (Low Dynamic Range) enhancement allows you to generate exposures from a single JPEG or RAW photo.</p><h2 id="Bonus-Tips-The-Best-Way-to-Edit-HDR-videos-on-your-Desktop"><a href="#Bonus-Tips-The-Best-Way-to-Edit-HDR-videos-on-your-Desktop" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Tips: The Best Way to Edit HDR videos on your Desktop"></a>Bonus Tips: The Best Way to Edit HDR videos on your Desktop</h2><p>Like HDR images, HDR videos offer more comprehensive displays in dark and bright surroundings. In short, these videos allow more colourful and detailed highlight representations. Unfortunately, not all HDR editing programs can merge bracketed exposures effortlessly to produce outstanding results. And those that do can cost you an arm and a leg.</p><p>With that in mind, we recommend <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora 11 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for professional and semi-professional HDR editors. It’s a simple but detailed program that allows users to edit HDR materials quickly and easily.

It provides manual and automatic lens correction properties, although using the manual option might need a learning curve. Other extras include ghost removal and automatic alignment.</p><ol><li><strong>Price – 4.7&#x2F;5</strong></li></ol><p>Easy HDR is not necessarily a free program. Although there’s a free demo version, it’s pretty limited in features. Therefore, purchase the premium plan for $33 or $55 for personal and lifetime licenses. As a seasoned HDR editor, you should know that other HDR programs like Aurora HDR cost way more than this.</p><ol><li><strong>Supported OS – 5&#x2F;5</strong></li></ol><p>This HDR photography program is compatible with Windows and macOS systems, which is a big plus. You can install it on Windows 7 or newer and macOS 10.12 or newer. Sorry, Linux users!</p><ol><li><strong>Ease of use – 4.8</strong></li></ol><p>Easy HDR is one of the most beginner-friendly HDR processing tools despite the advanced management tools. It features automatic lens correction, ghost removal, and HDR merging capabilities.</p><ol><li><strong>Best for – Beginner HDRi editors</strong></li></ol><p>This program’s simple approach makes it perfect for HDRi photographers without prior editing skills. Also, if you’re a beginner on a tight budget, easyHDR is the best software for you.</p><p><strong>Our Verdict</strong></p><p>Up to this juncture, you might wonder if Easy HDR is worth the money or not. Well, that depends on what you want. If you have minimal HDR editing knowledge, then this is the best professional program for you.</p><p>The straightforward layout boasts automatic HDR editing tools to make your work effortless. In addition, it supports a wide array of image formats, including photos taken using your DSLR camera. And the $33&#x2F;lifetime price should be manageable by many average Joes.</p><p>But on the flip side, Easy HDR lacks in-depth post-processing tools. Also, it lacks the all-important “undo” feature, which is vital in HDR image editing. Other than that, it’s the perfect program to make dramatic and realistic HDR photos.</p><p>Pros</p><ul><li>Simple layout.</li><li>Make realistic HDR images with automatic tools.</li><li>Easy HDRi Blender and Adobe Lightroom plugins.</li><li>Standalone Easy HDR desktop program.</li><li>Batch processing supported.</li><li>Compatible with multiple image formats, including RAW.</li></ul><p>Cons</p><ul><li>It doesn’t have advanced HDR post-processing tools.</li><li>No HDR feature for editing.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://otszone.ots7.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4713324&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://green.ots7.com/screenshots/OtsAV/OtsAVTV1.90-300x188.jpg"                      border="0"                >OtsAV TV Webcaster</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Detailed-Review-for-Easy-HDR-1"><a href="#Part-2-Detailed-Review-for-Easy-HDR-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Detailed Review for Easy HDR"></a>Part 2. Detailed Review for Easy HDR</h2><p>Before diving deeper into the detailed Easy HDR features, it’s important to note that the program has a demo version. You can use this version to practice and study the vital components of easyHDR. But be guided that the demo version exports images with a watermark. In addition, users can’t save HDRi in TIFF format. Let’s get in!</p><ol><li><strong>High-Quality Bracket Merging</strong></li></ol><p>A good quality HDRi software should easily merge different image exposures, making the photo look natural and spectacular. To start incorporating, drag the image brackets to easyHDR and press “Ok” on the pop-up screen. You can now try the different bracket merging effects until you find something that suits your preference.</p><ol><li><strong>Editing features</strong></li></ol><p>EasyHDR goes a step further to provide its users with a comprehensive list of editing features. For example, the “Clone Stamp” tool can remove unwanted objects like cables without blurring the photo. You can also use the “Tone Curve” feature to adjust the brightness of shadows and highlights.</p><ol><li><strong>Ghost removal</strong></li></ol><p>No, this is not the scary ghost that you know. Instead, these ghosting artefacts appear in misaligned photos due to moving objects like leaves, branches, cars, people, etc. With Easy HDR, you can eliminate the “ghosts” manually or automatically. Simply open the photo and turn on “Ghost Removal” to remove them automatically.</p><ol><li><strong>HDR batch processing</strong></li></ol><p>As expected, you can find it pretty tedious to import and merge each HDR bracket individually. For this reason, easyHDR comes with a “Batch Processing” feature that allows users to combine a whole folder of brackets automatically.</p><ol><li><strong>LDR enhancement</strong></li></ol><p>Although we’ve mainly focused on brackets and photos in this post, it’s important to note that easyHDR also works with single images. Instead of having three separate bracketed exposures, LDR (Low Dynamic Range) enhancement allows you to generate exposures from a single JPEG or RAW photo.</p><h2 id="Bonus-Tips-The-Best-Way-to-Edit-HDR-videos-on-your-Desktop-1"><a href="#Bonus-Tips-The-Best-Way-to-Edit-HDR-videos-on-your-Desktop-1" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Tips: The Best Way to Edit HDR videos on your Desktop"></a>Bonus Tips: The Best Way to Edit HDR videos on your Desktop</h2><p>Like HDR images, HDR videos offer more comprehensive displays in dark and bright surroundings. In short, these videos allow more colourful and detailed highlight representations. Unfortunately, not all HDR editing programs can merge bracketed exposures effortlessly to produce outstanding results. And those that do can cost you an arm and a leg.</p><p>With that in mind, we recommend <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora 11 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for professional and semi-professional HDR editors.

You can share live photo to devices runing iOS 9 or above. The OS X El Capitan also supports sharing the Live photos.</p><p> Remember one thing that while you open the iPhone live photos app, the audio option is always switched on. So, whatever you speak, shout, or discuss will be clearly recorded in the video. Keep in mind that shouting at the top of your voice and asking a person to move so that you can click a great view or moving pictures on iPhone can spoil your live photos.

It makes the content editing process a hassle-free, creative, and enjoyable activity. Also, beginners and amateur content editors can easily use Affinity Photo.</p><p>No matter you are a professional content creator or a newbie, we’ll be discussing how to remove background in Affinity Photo. Let’s explore how to use the good editing tool to be free of the stressful editing process.</p><h2 id="How-to-Remove-Affinity-Photo-to-Remove-Image’s-Background"><a href="#How-to-Remove-Affinity-Photo-to-Remove-Image’s-Background" class="headerlink" title="How to Remove Affinity Photo to Remove Image’s Background"></a>How to Remove Affinity Photo to Remove Image’s Background</h2><p>Affinity Photo is a simple and easy-to-use editing software, and you can remove a background in it under two scenarios: remove a white or a busy background.</p><h3 id="How-to-Erase-a-White-Background-in-Affinity-Designer"><a href="#How-to-Erase-a-White-Background-in-Affinity-Designer" class="headerlink" title="How to Erase a White Background in Affinity Designer"></a>How to Erase a White Background in Affinity Designer</h3><p>To erase a white background in Affinity Designer, do these steps:</p><p>Step1 In the first step, install the <a class="link"   href="https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/designer/" >Affinity Designer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>software and launch it on your computer. Go to <strong>“File” &gt; “Open”</strong> and head to the location of your image with a white background on your drive to import it.</p><p>Now access the <strong>Pixel Persona</strong> section in the left corner of the software screen by clicking the <strong>colored boxes</strong> icon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/accessing-the-pixel-persona-in-affinity-designer.png"                      alt="accessing the pixel persona in affinity designer"                ></p><p>Step2 Go to the <strong>“Layers”</strong> tab in the right pane, right-click your layer, and disable <strong>“Lock.”</strong> Now right-click on your layer again, and select <strong>“Rasterize”</strong> to enable editing of specific parts of the image.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/unlocking-the-image-layer-in-affinity-designer.png"                      alt="unlocking the image layer in affinity designer"                ></p><p>Step3 To make a selection around your subject, first enable the <strong>“Snap To Edges”</strong> and <strong>“Soft Edges”</strong> feature from the top toolbar. This will help you automatically detect the edges and give it a more tapered finish.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/enabling-snap-to-edges-and-soft-edges-in-affinity-designer.png"                      alt="enabling snap to edges and soft edges in affinity designer"                ></p><p>Set your brush size using your keyboard’s <strong>left</strong> and <strong>right bracket</strong> keys. Now, manually make a selection around your subject and white edges in the image as precisely as possible.</p><p>Step4 Next, zoom in on your subject. Press &amp; hold the ALT key on your keyboard, and use the Selection Brush tool to manually correct the rough edges of your outline.</p><p>Click the <strong>“Refine”</strong> option in the toolbar to open the <strong>“Refine Selection”</strong> menu. A red mask will be applied to your subject, giving you an idea of how your image will look once you remove the background. Zoom in and if any details are excluded, paint them over. Once you are satisfied, click <strong>“Apply”</strong> to save your changes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/refining-the-outline-around-the-image-to-remove-background-in-affinity-designer.png"                      alt="refining the outline around the image to remove background in affinity designer"                ></p><p>Step5 In the last step, press the <strong>“Delete”</strong> key on your keyboard to remove the background, or click <strong>“Edit”</strong> and choose the <strong>“Cut”</strong> option.</p><p>Now, hit <strong>“Control+D”</strong> to deselect the selection. Alternatively, you can click <strong>“Select”</strong> in the top toolbar and choose the <strong>“Deselect”</strong> option. Finally, you can export your file using the <strong>“File” &gt; “Export”</strong> option.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://twopages.pxf.io/c/5597632/1873313/18544" target="_top" id="1873313"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18544-1873313"                      border="0" alt="" width="1080" height="1263"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1873313/18544"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="How-to-Remove-a-Busy-Background-in-Affinity-Designer"><a href="#How-to-Remove-a-Busy-Background-in-Affinity-Designer" class="headerlink" title="How to Remove a Busy Background in Affinity Designer"></a>How to Remove a Busy Background in Affinity Designer</h3><p>If you want to remove a busy background of an image in the Affinity Designer software, follow these steps carefully:</p><p>Step1 Click the <strong>“File”</strong> option in Affinity Designer and select <strong>“Open”</strong> from the drop-down menu. Select your image and click <strong>“Open”</strong> to import your picture.</p><p>From the right-side panel, open the <strong>Layers</strong> tab and click the <strong>“Lock”</strong> icon to unlock your image layer, which is set as locked by default. Now, right-click on the layer and select <strong>“Rasterize &amp; Trim.”</strong> Rasterization will help remove the background.</p><p>Step2 Next, you have to make a selection around your object&#x2F;subject in the picture. Click the <strong>“Selection Brush”</strong> tool from the left-side panel to do so.</p><p>Now your cursor will be changed to a circle. To increase or decrease the brush size, use the <strong>Right</strong> and <strong>Left Bracket</strong> keys on your keyboard. Now, move around the brush on your image to outline your subject.</p><p>Step3 Once you’ve made a selection around your object, it’s time to refine it to make it more precise. To do so, click the <strong>“Refine”</strong> option from the top toolbar to open the <strong>“Refine Selection”</strong> menu.</p><p>Focus on the <strong>Foreground</strong> and <strong>Background</strong> brushes in the <strong>Refine Selection</strong> menu and toggle between these settings to make your selection more accurate. You can use the <strong>Right or Left Bracket</strong> key on your keyboard to adjust the brush size where needed.<br>Once satisfied with your changes, click the <strong>“Apply”</strong> option in the <strong>Refine Selection</strong> menu to save your settings.</p><p>Step4 Now that you’ve outlined your subject clearly and precisely, it’s time to remove the busy background. To do so, click the <strong>Delete key</strong> on your keyboard if you use a Windows PC.</p><p>If you are using a Mac system, click <strong>“Edit”</strong> in the toolbar and select <strong>“Cut”</strong> from the drop-down menu.

This side project became an instant success for Google and has attracted customers all around the world costing only 20$ this is one of the cheapest headsets anyone can get in the market. The best thing about Google cardboard is that the design is open source and anyone can make one at home just by following few clear instructions. Google’s vision of technology to everyone is working and cardboard is one step towards their main goal.</p><p> The Samsung Gear VR is the product that comes when you combine the expertise of the best Virtual Reality Company and the best smart phone brand in the world. Samsung Gear VR is a combined collaboration between Samsung and Oculus. This Virtual reality headset is made for only Samsung phones and retails around 100$ which is almost 5 times more than the Google cardboard. Gear VR is packed with functionality it has a very firm phone stand inside of which you can easily put any phone. It connects to your phone through the charging port and as soon as you connect the phone it starts the VR software in it. You can also control the volume and the zoom through this headset. You can also play many games on it through the Oculus app which is present on the app store for Gear VR only.</p><h3 id="Samsung-Gear-VR"><a href="#Samsung-Gear-VR" class="headerlink" title="Samsung Gear VR"></a>Samsung Gear VR</h3><p> Samsung just partnered with Oculus to bring you the Samsung Gear VR headset in 2014 and now the new Samsung Gear VR introduced with the Galaxy S7 is jam packed with new features that are ready to blow your mind. The new Gear is 19 percent lighter than the previous model so it doesn’t feel like a brick tied to your head. The straps are more elastic and give a better fit than the previous model, the padding around the eyes and nose gives a very comfortable grip. The new VR has a USB type c port you can also switch it micro USB to make it compatible with the older versions of Samsung phones.</p><p> The best part about the new Samsung Gear is the new lens that is clearer and gives a glare free view of the screen. Along with the new lens there are some more features in the Samsung Gear VR, You can plug in headphones in your phone and enjoy the whole VR experience with sound Samsung ahs specially made ports in the headset for it. Samsung has also introduced some buttons to change the volume of the device from the Gear itself. The previous versions had a problem that the lenses tend to mist up thus making you unable to see clearly but in this version the issue has been resolved.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://homestyler.sjv.io/c/5597632/2044747/22993" target="_top" id="2044747"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-2044747"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2044747/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Google-Cardboard"><a href="#Google-Cardboard" class="headerlink" title="Google Cardboard"></a>Google Cardboard</h3><p> Google has been changing our concepts about technology for quite some time now and they are certainly succeeding in their mission. Google Cardboard is a product started by Google employees as a side project but it certainly became more than a side project. The main selling point of the Cardboard is that it is really cheap and everyone can afford one. Plus you don’t need a high end smart phone to work with cardboard it can work with any android phone. The Google cardboard VR is compatible with multiple phones and is really portable and these are its basic selling points. Other than that there are not many qualities in the headset it is just a cardboard holder that you have to hold with hand with lens in it.</p><p> Google cardboard does not have any volume control options no flaps straps to attach the device directly on your head, the build quality is as poor as it can get. There are many downsides to the Google cardboard but if you look at its price you realize it is a pretty good deal for 20$ you are getting a VR headset who would’ve thought this was possible?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=37100474&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://awario.com/images/pages/index/img-platform-ui-1280@1x.avif"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Benjamin Arango</p><p>Benjamin Arango is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Benjamin Arango</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-ideal-14-visual-effects-with-text-animations/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Ideal 14 Visual Effects with Text Animations</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-unmatched-5-apps-for-harmonious-photoplussound-creation/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Unmatched 5 Apps for Harmonious Photo+Sound Creation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-buyers-path-to-a-top-360-camera-purchase-guide-for-2024/"><u>[New] Buyer's Path to a Top 360 Camera Purchase Guide for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-implementing-look-up-tables-luts-to-elevate-design-work-for-2024/"><u>[New] Implementing Look-Up Tables (LUTs) to Elevate Design Work for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-decoding-the-mystery-of-smooth-iphone-images-four-ways/"><u>[New] In 2024, Decoding the Mystery of Smooth iPhone Images (Four Ways)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-next-level-mp4-experience-integrating-advanced-srt-audio/"><u>[New] Next-Level MP4 Experience  Integrating Advanced SRT Audio</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-picscanners-face-blurring-made-easy-for-everyone-for-2024/"><u>[New] PicScanner's Face-Blurring Made Easy for Everyone for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-transform-your-projects-with-these-top-10-ae-types-for-2024/"><u>[New] Transform Your Projects with These Top 10 AE Types for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-understanding-your-macs-capabilities-in-big-sur/"><u>[New] Understanding Your Mac's Capabilities in Big Sur</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-unleashing-audio-delights-the-art-of-apple-podcast-download/"><u>[New] Unleashing Audio Delights  The Art of Apple Podcast Download</u></a></li><li><a href="https://driver-install.techidaily.com/solved-conexant-hd-audio-drivers-for-windows-10/"><u>[Solved] Conexant HD Audio Drivers for Windows 10</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-decoding-the-advanced-features-of-nikon-d7500/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Decoding the Advanced Features of Nikon D7500</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-the-ultimate-11-easy-to-operate-kids-wet-weather-camcorders/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  The Ultimate 11 Easy-to-Operate Kids' Wet Weather Camcorders</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-classic-console-charisma-best-ps1-emulation-tools-reviewed/"><u>[Updated] Classic Console Charisma -

These are commonly used in logo design, with images made of curves, lines, and points that come together based on a mathematical formula to form vibrant and non-pixelated digital artwork.</p><p>If you plan to create branded digital logos, you should know what they are and their difference from raster images. Here, we will discuss that specifically, including the types and software options to help create stunning ones. Let’s get started.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/beginners-guide-to-all-things-vector-images-overview-types-and-software-choices-1.jpg"                      alt="vector image vs zoomed in image in bitmap image"                ></p><h2 id="Part-I-The-Art-of-Vector-Images"><a href="#Part-I-The-Art-of-Vector-Images" class="headerlink" title="Part I. The Art of Vector Images"></a>Part I. The Art of Vector Images</h2><p>Understanding what you will deal with in the name of <strong>vector images</strong> should be the first step. That is precisely what we will discuss here, beginning with what stands for vector as a picture format.</p><h3 id="What-are-Vector-Images"><a href="#What-are-Vector-Images" class="headerlink" title="What are Vector Images?"></a>What are Vector Images?</h3><p>A vector image is a graphics-based file format made of a group of points with lines to join them. The vector drawing program’s point-to-point illustration helps create complex and straightforward line-based geometric shapes. Therefore, when you see the images, it looks smoother and barely pixelated when zoomed into the image.</p><p>Users can add gradients and solid color within the shapes, and all of its information, like the point coordination and how the shape is filled, is stored via mathematical equations. In graphic design, the computer uses mathematical data to render the vector image. For this, it connects the “Paths” (lines) and fills within the shape with color.</p><p>Currently, many professional editors use top-quality <strong>software to create vector images</strong> for digital objects with optimized geometrical precision. It is commonly used in areas like typography, 3D rendering, and engineering, all of which require software that can decompose complex data into simplified geometric primitives.</p><p>The common types of these images that graphic designers and other professionals work with now are WMF, SVG, EPS, CDR, PDF, or AI-based graphic files. But most people deal with raster images, so they do not have some confusion about what vector files are.</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Bitmap Images</strong></th><th><strong>Vector Images</strong></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>WHAT IS</strong></td><td>Bitmap or Vector images are arranged in a grid pattern of multi-colored pixels to form an image.Examples include BMP, GIF, APNG, JPEG&#x2F;JPG, MPEG4, and WebP.</td><td>Vector images are a graphical type of image format which is made of geometric shapes on a type of cartesian place, including elements like curves, lines, points, and polygons.Examples include WMF, SVG, EPS, CDR, and PDF.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>PROS</strong></td><td>1. The images are easier to produce and distribute across platforms, devices, and other conventional input-output devices, like scanners, inkjet printers, etc.2. It is compatible with different types of image types, like posters to small badges.3. These have very high processing speeds.4. Users can create different types of images without any concern about complexity.</td><td>1. Best for graphic design artwork, like branded logos and documents.2. When you zoom the images, there are no noticeable pixels and the image still looks smooth.3. When you try to decrease or increase a digitized object, the lines with pre-specified width is not controlled as per the image size.4. It is easier to scale, move, or rotate the vector images without affecting image quality.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>CONS</strong></td><td>1. It only looks natural when seeing the images on a small scale or from far. When zoomed, the pictures look pixelated and rougher.2. Blurry appearance.</td><td>1. Showing the image in low resolution has a different level of quality.2. Only some graphic types will look good in vector file format.</td></tr></tbody></table><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ukaidot.sjv.io/c/5597632/1793233/19578" target="_top" id="1793233"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19578-1793233"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="1200"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1793233/19578"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="What-are-vector-images-used-for"><a href="#What-are-vector-images-used-for" class="headerlink" title="What are vector images used for?"></a>What are vector images used for?</h3><p>Vector images are highly utilized in professional branding work, as the format gels so well with published and printed material.
