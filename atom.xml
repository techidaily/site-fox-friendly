The FAA predicts that by the year 2020, a massive seven million drones could be sold in the U.S. alone; that’s about two and a half times the entire population of Nevada!</p><p>When it comes to buying a drone, the undisputed drone king right now is, without a doubt, Chinese company <a class="link"   href="https://www.dji.com/" >DJI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Having achieved amazing success with the highly portable Mavic Pro in 2016, and with the pocket rocket DJI Spark last year, the world held its breath to see what was coming next.</p><p>What did come next was something truly amazing; perhaps a real game changer. Neatly squeezing in the middle of their two highly successful products came the brand-new Mavic Air; a quadcopter that is highly portable, incredibly powerful and, dare we say it, a little bit sexier than its predecessors. But does it live up to the promise, and how does it compare with the amazingly popular, entry level DJI Spark?</p><p>If you’re looking for easy portability, the DJI Spark is smaller and lighter but can’t be folded. When you collapse the arms on the Mavic Air, it’s compact and easy to stow, making it far more transportable than many of its predecessors.</p><p>If performance is key for you, it’s crucial to know that the Mavic Air will offer you a longer flight time by a substantial five minutes and is also faster by around 18.4km per hour, compared to the Spark. In addition to this, the range of the Mavic Air is a massive 50 per cent further than the Spark, at a huge 4km compared to 2km.</p><p>In terms of photographic capabilities, both drones offer some pretty good specs. However, the DJI Mavic Air outpaces the smaller Spark in terms of image quality, topping out at 100mbps compared to 24mbps and recording in up to 4K definition at 12MP. The Spark is configured to run at 1080p only. Both models offer obstacle avoidance and have numerous features, but on almost every specification, the Mavic Air seems to do just a little bit better.</p><p>So, is the more expensive DJI Mavic Air really worth the extra investment? With a price tag in the region of $400 to $700 more than that of the Spark packages, it’s a question well worth considering.

After all, a longer flight life means the longer you have to make sure you get your perfect shot (video or still frame,) or are able to more thoroughly inspect whatever it is you are looking to inspect. Basically, at the end of the day a longer flight time directly relates to having more fun.</p><p>While it is true that you can (and should) carry some <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >extra batteries <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with you while piloting your drone, stopping what you are doing to change batteries out can be a real hassle, and a drain on your productivity.

A little over 50% of those users don’t have Spotify premium. This means they will be exposed to ads. So, you have a potential audience of over 200 million people.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://headphonesaddict.com/listening-to-music-statistics/" >23% of all recorded users <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> use a streaming service like Spotify to listen to music. This is the highest percentage compared to all other methods of listening to music. The most common devices used are a car’s radio and smartphones.</p><p>Additionally, Spotify’s ads system is quite effective. Most of their free-plan users expect to hear ads. Therefore, they are prepared and will listen through the entire ad while focusing on the message.</p><p>These are more than enough reasons to understand the potential of Spotify ads.</p><p>Also, did you know that you can create several ads on Spotify that differ significantly? Yes, there are four significant types of Spotify ads.</p><h2 id="4-Main-Types-of-Spotify-Ads-How-to-Choose-the-Best-One-1"><a href="#4-Main-Types-of-Spotify-Ads-How-to-Choose-the-Best-One-1" class="headerlink" title="4 Main Types of Spotify Ads (How to Choose the Best One)"></a>4 Main Types of Spotify Ads (How to Choose the Best One)</h2><p>We already discussed the incredible potential and exposure ads on Spotify can bring. Now, it’s time to find out what type of ad will be ideal in your case.</p><h3 id="Audio-Ads-1"><a href="#Audio-Ads-1" class="headerlink" title="Audio Ads"></a>Audio Ads</h3><p>Any guide to Spotify ads will tell you that their audio ads are the easiest to create. Anyone can make them. You must record a 15-30 second audio clip sharing your message.</p><p>Spotify’s Ad Studio offers fantastic tools to help you create your ads. You may also place a creative image on the ad with a link straight to your landing page, website, or offer.</p><p>The idea is to make this a straightforward process that makes the listener want to click.</p><p>Spotify is accurate at predicting when the user is most receptive. That’s when it will play your audio ad.</p><h3 id="Spotify-Video-Ads-1"><a href="#Spotify-Video-Ads-1" class="headerlink" title="Spotify Video Ads"></a>Spotify Video Ads</h3><p>Video ads on Spotify are 15 to 30-second clips that include audio and visuals to convey a message. They can be played on both Desktop and Mobile.</p><p>Spotify will display these ads when the user is actively engaged on the screen. However, it will not play them if their phone is locked and if Spotify is not active on the net.</p><p>There are two types of Spotify video ads you can use, namely video Takeover Ads and Spotify Sponsored Sessions. Choosing the one that’s right for you can significantly increase conversions.</p><p><strong>Takeover ads</strong> pop up when you’re actively going through Spotify and its music catalogues. <strong>Sponsored Sessions</strong> are video ads that let you watch them in exchange for 30 minutes of ad-free music.</p><p>Compared to Spotify audio ads, video ads offer a few advantages:</p><ul><li>Video ads play unmuted and allow for a more visual presentation of what is being advertised</li><li>They can be displayed when users are actively using the app</li><li>Each video ad can grant you the chance to use Spotify ad-free for 30 minutes per ad watched</li></ul><h3 id="Overlay-Ads-Display-Ads-1"><a href="#Overlay-Ads-Display-Ads-1" class="headerlink" title="Overlay Ads (Display Ads)"></a>Overlay Ads (Display Ads)</h3><p>These ads do not have audio or video in them at all. They include an image that showcases what you are offering. They can be cheaper than other types of Spotify ads as well.</p><p>Usually, an overlay ad will be displayed at the top of the Spotify app. Whenever the user goes back to the Spotify interface, that’s when these ads will be displayed. Users can click on them and be led to wherever your landing destination is set online.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xq2r4ZKM-Po?si=fA2DdEB1op-atCkz&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Sponsored-List-1"><a href="#Sponsored-List-1" class="headerlink" title="Sponsored List"></a>Sponsored List</h3><p>Also known as Spotify Sponsored Playlists, they allow you to launch a brand awareness campaign on Spotify.

It delivers brilliantly on some key features visual professionals want including an impressive 31.5-inch display, an IPS LCD, HDR 10 support, high-level color accuracy and depth, and the latest in DisplayPort technology.</p><p> The BenQ SW320 monitor started making waves long before it hit the market. That’s because it proposed to offer premium visual rendering functionality for a quarter of the price of its nearest high-end competitor. At roughly $1500, the SW320 is a steal for visual professionals who are keen to improve their workflow while remaining on the cutting edge of their practice.</p><p> Its 3840 x 2160px 4K display does require a powerful graphics processor to reach peak performance. The good news is that the cost of high-level graphic processing is on a downward trajectory. With a top performing monitor like the BenQ SW320, professional photographers, videographers and graphic artists can work with colors and details that are on par with nature’s artistry and their lofty creative aspirations.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X4q6gyaEojM?si=ImdFm6Zsr0azykqV&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="BenQ-SW320-4K-Monitor-Pros-and-Cons"><a href="#BenQ-SW320-4K-Monitor-Pros-and-Cons" class="headerlink" title="BenQ SW320 4K Monitor Pros and Cons"></a>BenQ SW320 4K Monitor Pros and Cons</h2><p> This monitor has many positives to tally. The most notable has to be its state-of-the-art input port technologies. It sports an HDMI 2.0 port, a DisplayPort 1.4 and a mini DisplayPort 1.4. These input sockets have the necessary bandwidth to support its 4k UHD screen, its high-fidelity color renditions and its HDR functionality.</p><p> Also worthy of note is its effective stand which lets users adjust the positioning of the screen for best viewing results. On its stand, the BenQ SW320 monitor can make a 20-degree upward tilt, a 45-degree right or left swivel, and a 90-degree pivot from landscape to portrait mode.</p><p> The swivel feature does fall short of what professional studio designers may require. A photographer who needs to swivel the monitor to show a colleague her work may find a 45-degree swivel insufficient.</p><p> Another significant downside has to do with uniformity across its screen. According to some testers, the SW320 shows noticeable color tints towards the edges when set to display all-white. This is perceptible even when its Brightness Uniformity feature is enabled. While uniformity is something most monitors fail to achieve 100%, it’s not out of place to expect that a monitor as powerful and as groundbreaking as the BenQ SW320 would succeed where others have not.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aYH0B2HqcIM?si=3fkoG85L6hAeB4ok&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Hardware-Design"><a href="#Hardware-Design" class="headerlink" title="Hardware Design"></a>Hardware Design</h2><h4 id="1-Design-Style"><a href="#1-Design-Style" class="headerlink" title="1.Design Style"></a>1.Design Style</h4><p> The design of the BenQ SW320 is ideal for Professional photographers. It has a minimal black finish with an optimal bezel size and a matte screen surface that minimizes harsh glare.</p><p> The SW320 also has the right support apparatus. As mentioned above, it ships with a very efficient stand that provides ample support for its relatively heavy bulk. It is also a VESA compatible monitor. This means that it has standardized slots designed to let it be mounted on a wall.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benq-sw320-hotkey-puck-button.jpg"                      alt="benq-sw320-hotkey-puck-button"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XS1nQCe95LU?si=A2dhdFkSAI61_nKA&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> The most novel design feature of the SW320 is the remote-control Puck which stows seamlessly in a round slot located at the base of its stand. The puck connects to the back of the monitor and is a great convenience utility. It has the right size and bulk to fit effortlessly into any visual professional’s workflow while providing quick access to OSD menus.</p><p> With so much going for it, the BenQ SW320 has yet another functional tool many pros are sure to appreciate. It comes with a Monitor Shading Hood that blocks stray light from altering the color accuracy of images on its screen.</p><h4 id="2-Ports-and-Connectivity"><a href="#2-Ports-and-Connectivity" class="headerlink" title="2.

Its HDMI 2.O port, Display port 1.4 and mini DisplayPort 1.4 are located at the lower back side of the monitor. It also has a 3.5mm headphone jack and an AC power cable slot also located at its lower back side. The HDMI 2.0 port enables HDR support while the DisplayPort 1.4 enables full 10-bit color displays. To access these ports conveniently, users need only swivel the monitor slightly in the clockwise direction until the input panel is plainly in view.</p><p> In addition to having the right input slots to support its high-level visual performance, the SW320 also has 2 USB 3.0 slots and one SD Card slot located on its left side. BenQ takes the guesswork out of using these input slots correctly by supplying the right cables. Furthermore, there’s a cable management hole built into its stand that makes keeping a tidy set up very easy.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PUDdKOsEN74?si=tkZf-KVinjuwmgx9&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Features-and-Performance"><a href="#Features-and-Performance" class="headerlink" title="Features and Performance"></a>Features and Performance</h2><h4 id="1-Color-Performance"><a href="#1-Color-Performance" class="headerlink" title="1. Color Performance"></a>1. Color Performance</h4><p> High-level color performance is a major strong suit of the BenQ SW320. When it comes to the number of colors it can render, this monitor packs a powerful punch. It can display a staggering 1.07 billion colors in multiple color gamuts. It is also Technicolor certified for both color accuracy and consistency.</p><p> It supports 10-bit color display and a 14-bit color LUT, and can render 99% of the sRGB color gamut as well as 99% of the AdobeRGB color gamut. Its coverage of the AdobeRGB gamut is particularly significant because AdobeRGB has an extended blue and green gamut compared to sRGB. As a result, AdobeRGB is better at rendering colors from nature.</p><p> AdobeRGB and sRGB aside, this monitor also has additional built-in color modes such as Black and White, DCI-P3, HDR and CAD&#x2F;CAM.</p><p> What’s really impressive is how easy it is to compare images in 2 color modes on the SW320. With Picture-in-Picture and Picture-by-Picture settings, a professional photographer can compare images in different color modes side-by-side. Enabling the PIP&#x2F;PBP feature through the HotKey Puck or joystick activates BenQ’s proprietary GamutDuo. GamutDuo is the feature which supports this on-screen color-mode comparison feature.</p><p> The SW320’s HDR support is another remarkable color performance feature. High Dynamic Rate support makes it possible to render more colors in the black and white range. It’s an all-important feature of High-Definition TVs. With this feature, the SW320 can achieve picture brilliance on par with HD-TV sets and other screens designed for entertainment purposes. This level of image quality enables professionals to produce top-quality work while also advancing the realm of possibility for their craft.</p><h4 id="2-Calibration"><a href="#2-Calibration" class="headerlink" title="2. Calibration"></a>2. Calibration</h4><p> Though most powerful monitors have what it takes to render colors accurately, how well they achieve this level of performance will depend on how well and how often they’re calibrated. The same is true for the SW320 which supports external hardware calibration. BenQ has a proprietary color calibration software known as Palette Master Element. This software works well with a number of external calibration devices such as X-Rite, Spyder and Display Pro. Using the software and hardware together, the SW320 can be set to perform at optimal color fidelity and depth.</p><p> Before calibrating any BenQ SW320 straight out of the box, it’s a good idea to go over the individual performance report that ships with it. Each report is unique. It provides a reliable baseline for understanding and assessing an SW320’s performance over time. Beyond its utility, these reports are also a good indication of BenQ’s commitment to quality and excellence.</p><h4 id="3-Ease-of-Use"><a href="#3-Ease-of-Use" class="headerlink" title="3. Ease of Use"></a>3. Ease of Use</h4><p> One could argue that the effectiveness of a device’s assembly manual is a good measure of how well it is designed. In this regard, the BenQ SW320 scores another homerun. Its illustrated assembly manual is easy to follow. This allows for a stress-free set up experience that’s bound to be reassuring to anyone who’s spent $1500 on a monitor.</p><p> In the assembly manual, each part is labelled and arrows are used effectively to show how parts fit together. This clear sequencing means that most users can assemble their SW320s themselves. Granted its assembly manual makes setting up easy, there’s no shame in asking for help and doing some research. The SW320’s Monitor Shading Hood in particular, may prove a bit more difficult to assemble than the rest of the unit.</p><h4 id="4-Highlighted-Features"><a href="#4-Highlighted-Features" class="headerlink" title="4. Highlighted Features"></a>4. Highlighted Features</h4><p> Getting to know the strengths of the BenQ SW320 monitor is much like peeling back the layers of an onion. Many of its coolest features are nested within others and may not be apparent unless discussed. One such strength is the fact that due to its IPS LCD panel, the SW320 can display colors consistently at up to 178 degrees. This means that color depth and accuracy remain unchanged when this monitor is viewed from wide horizontally and vertically angles. This is certainly great for multi-viewer situations and in a way, compensates for the somewhat limited swivel angle of the SW320.</p><p> The Delta-E(ΔE) figures for this monitor are also very impressive and provide a sense of the high-level color fidelity it delivers consistently. Delta-E represents the difference between the color requested and the actual color rendered by the monitor. In general, figures under 2.0 are considered very good. According to some testers, the SW320 consistently scores a Delta-E that’s less than 1.2. This means that in many color modes, this monitor renders colors that are very true to what’s expected.</p><p> One last feature worth highlighting is the HotKey Puck’s custom option. It takes quick Display Menu access to a whole new level. While it is set by default to lead to standard menu options like Display, Color Adjustment and PIP&#x2F;PBP, the buttons on the Puck can actually be set to any functionality depending on what a user prefers. This includes custom color calibrations and any other custom settings a user may need in her workflow.</p><h4 id="5-Responsiveness"><a href="#5-Responsiveness" class="headerlink" title="5.Responsiveness"></a>5.Responsiveness</h4><p> As far as responsiveness goes, the SW320 is an okay performer. Its IPN LCD panel has a best response rate of 5ms. While this is great for rendering HD pictures and HD Video editing, it makes this monitor unsuited for quick-action gaming. Gaming monitors tend to have TN LCD panels precisely because they afford an excellent 1ms response rate that ensures screen-tearing and stuttering are minimized.</p><p> With its 5ms response rate, the SW320 may experience noticeable image rendering failures if used for fast-action gaming. For the most part however, this monitor performs exceedingly well for professional image processing and alright for minimal gaming use. It is worth emphasizing that the BenQ SW320 monitor is specifically designed to be used by visual design professionals. In light of this, its 5ms response rate is more than sufficient.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p> We can all agree that the BenQ SW320 has an impressive roll of positives. Assessed by any standard, it performs superbly and delivers many pleasant surprises to boot.</p><p> With this monitor, users need not worry about being hampered by outdated hardware any time soon. The BenQ SW320 comes with the latest in display and input port technologies. Far from being left behind, the BenQ may up the demand for PCs that have powerful GPUs and the latest output ports.</p><p> For professional photographers, videographers and Graphic Designers, the SW320 is a dream. At an affordable price bracket of $1450 - $1500, this monitor puts state-of-the-art color processing features within reach. And with proprietary features like GamutDuo and Palette Master Element, Visual Professionals can optimize their workflow significantly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-mastering-graphics-a-guide-to-a-flourishing-career-for-2024/"><u>[New] Mastering Graphics A Guide to a Flourishing Career for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-mastering-video-reversal-on-ios-devices-for-2024/"><u>[New] Mastering Video Reversal on iOS Devices for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/ptimal-youtube-video-formats-a-comprehensive-guide/"><u>[New] Optimal YouTube Video Formats A Comprehensive Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-top-places-for-free-text-visual-enhancements-for-2024/"><u>[New] Top Places for Free Text Visual Enhancements for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-enhancing-team-coordination-through-thoughtful-office-spaces/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Enhancing Team Coordination Through Thoughtful Office Spaces</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-discovering-the-best-drone-motor-choices-for-enhanced-control-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Discovering the Best Drone Motor Choices for Enhanced Control for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-ideal-sites-convert-your-favorite-youtube-moments-into-ringtones/"><u>[Updated] Ideal Sites Convert Your Favorite YouTube Moments Into Ringtones</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-gopro-face-off-a-detailed-comparison-guide/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, GoPro Face-Off A Detailed Comparison Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-online-orbiters-youtube-personalities-at-the-zenith/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Online Orbiters YouTube Personalities at the Zenith</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/2024-approved-navigating-the-lands-marketplace-of-product-sponsored-youtube-content/"><u>2024 Approved Navigating the Lands Marketplace of Product-Sponsored YouTube Content</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techno-recovery.techidaily.com/fixing-netflix-problems-on-lg-tv-a-comprehensive-guide-with-19-tips-and-techniques/"><u>Fixing Netflix Problems on LG TV: A Comprehensive Guide with 19 Tips and Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://hardware-help.techidaily.com/monitor-at-best-buy-for-prime-day-zdnet-insider-tips/"><u>Monitor at Best Buy for Prime Day | ZDNET Insider Tips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/step-by-step-to-a-perfectly-arranged-youtube-queue/"><u>Step-by-Step to a Perfectly Arranged YouTube Queue</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/to-use-itop-recorder-a-compelling-case/"><u>To Use ITop Recorder A Compelling Case?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://mondly-stories.techidaily.com/yearly-goals-achievable-or-just-dreams/"><u>Yearly Goals: Achievable or Just Dreams?</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Pros and Cons of Telegram Marketing"></a>Part 1. Pros and Cons of Telegram Marketing</h2><p>Firstly, let’s look into why we should seize the opportunities to develop marketing on Telegram.

However, it also means that you will have to build your network of followers interested in what you have to say before reaching out to them with marketing messages.</li><li><strong>Difficult Access to a Wider Audience:</strong> Telegram is mainly used by cryptocurrency enthusiasts and those already familiar with blockchain technology. As such, it will be difficult for you to reach out to those people who have not heard about blockchain or crypts yet.</li><li><strong>Less Engagement</strong>: Another disadvantage of Telegram marketing is less engagement compared to other social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram. It can be challenging to hunt for people who want to follow your brand on Telegram. Also, it won’t be easy to keep them engaged in your community after finding them.</li><li><strong>The Inability to Track User Activity:</strong> There are no analytics tools available on Telegram. For example, you can’t use Google Analytics or other similar tools to track engagement and conversions to understand your target audience and establish what works for them.</li><li><strong>No Public Visibility for Your Brand:</strong> No public platform means no public visibility for your brand or product. You can expect only those people to see your marketing content already using the Telegram platform and have added you as a friend.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Marketing-Opportunities-on-Telegram"><a href="#Part-2-Marketing-Opportunities-on-Telegram" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

First thing to get aware with when going for silhouetted photo is making sure what subject you choose. You should make certain that your subject carries a convincing and recognizable shape. The picture would also be compelling when taken against a setting sun, behind a curtain or sheet. Let us now get the tips and techniques in detail for perfect silhouette photography with your iPhone.</p><h3 id="Tips"><a href="#Tips" class="headerlink" title="Tips"></a>Tips</h3><h4 id="1-Light-Source"><a href="#1-Light-Source" class="headerlink" title="1.  Light Source"></a>1.  Light Source</h4><p> Silhouette photography can be best done when the shot is taken against the source of light. The camera sensor generally fails to interpret the shadow details unlike a human eye. And therefore shooting against the light will help in providing the best silhouette effect. It simply implies keeping the subject against the sunlight or other source of light to get an automatic silhouette and shadowy effect. The most excellent way for emphasized and perfect silhouette photography is ensuring to shoot when there is low sunlight i.e. the time of sunrise and sunset.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/silouette-agiant-light.jpg"                      alt="silouette-agiant-light"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YB7Ou4-iKVM?si=7Fq8iUwI8voccMLx&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Image source: Digital Photo Secrets</p><h4 id="2-Low-POV"><a href="#2-Low-POV" class="headerlink" title="2.  Low POV"></a>2.  Low POV</h4><p> A yet another tip for silhouetting effect is capturing the view from a low angle. When you will get down a little lower and capture from a low angle, it will present the picture with a plain and simple background and there will be no clumsiness related to background. The photo taken from low point or by lying down on the ground will result in position changing of the subject and adding more interest to it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/silhouette-low-pov.jpg"                      alt="silhouette-low-pov"                ></p><p> Image source: Gettyimages</p><h4 id="3-Lucid-Backgrounds"><a href="#3-Lucid-Backgrounds" class="headerlink" title="3.  Lucid Backgrounds"></a>3.  Lucid Backgrounds</h4><p> Background is one of the chief things to be considered while doing any kind of photography. When you do iPhone silhouette snapping, a mess-free background is what you should take into account. Keeping sky as the background would be perfect choice and the silhouette photography will go perfect when there are clouds in the sky. The subject will acquire a really dramatic effect. Birds and trees are other suggestions for better backdrop of your picture. In short, you should always consider the background when you desire an ideal silhouetted photo. Also, low angle shoot will work here too.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/silouette-photo-simple-background.jpg"                      alt="silouette-photo-simple-background"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gSKkJrJ57EA?si=WDOmInPE9EgQa_tB&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Image source: Pexels</p><h4 id="4-Space-is-Essential"><a href="#4-Space-is-Essential" class="headerlink" title="4.  Space is Essential"></a>4.  Space is Essential</h4><p> A very simple thing to keep in mind while going for silhouette photo moment is leaving enough space when the scene contains several subjects. This is important since it will become difficult to recognize the subject. For example, if there is a family silhouette photo, if you won’t give space, they will be difficult to identify separately in that shadowy effect. However, when shooting stationary subjects and they are very close, ensure a little change in the shooting angle. On the other hand, if shooting moving subjects, do it only when you feel a sufficient space between them.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/silhouette-photo-space.jpg"                      alt="silhouette-photo-space"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yDuvbv0QOYI?si=byottcEM_Rrvi4EL&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Image source: astro-canada.ca</p><h4 id="5-Ensuring-Accurate-Focus-Exposure"><a href="#5-Ensuring-Accurate-Focus-Exposure" class="headerlink" title="5.  Ensuring Accurate Focus &amp; Exposure"></a>5.  Ensuring Accurate Focus &amp; Exposure</h4><p> When you decide to take an iPhone silhouette photo, please note that iPhone offers a sound exposure that can help creating a pleasing silhouette. The device’s exposure is set automatically to the subject. In case of silhouette photography, it can happen that your subject is relatively large and when the exposure is automatically set to the subject, your silhouette picture can be destroyed ultimately fading the background. Therefore, in this case, you can just tap on the background place which is ideally the brightest part like cloud in the sky. This will in turn give a silhouette effect. Hence, setting focus and exposure accurately is necessary for processing exceptional silhouette photography.</p><h4 id="6-Increase-contrast"><a href="#6-Increase-contrast" class="headerlink" title="6. Increase contrast"></a>6. Increase contrast</h4><p> You can also apply post-production concept to get the remarkable silhouette effect in your snaps. This takes a little moderation in the photography after when you click it. You can use adjustments for a better silhouette effect by adding fair amount of light levels or darkness and highlight your subject. For the adjustments, increasing the contrast would be a recommended option to make the silhouette look darker and brighter. On the other hand, you can use a little amount of vignette effect at the outer range of the photo. This will bring better attention to your subject at the center and will make your silhouette photography moment perfect.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/silhouette-photo-contrast.jpg"                      alt="silhouette-photo-contrast"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/43goO8X0iX0?si=48Cqf6td2q_6T6h3&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Image source: Flickr</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Ollie Mattison</p><p>Ollie Mattison is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Ollie Mattison</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-the-path-to-outstanding-interviewer-expertise/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved The Path to Outstanding Interviewer Expertise</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-the-complete-instagram-analytics-companion-transforming-metrics-into-strategy/"><u>[New] In 2024, The Complete Instagram Analytics Companion Transforming Metrics Into Strategy</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-choosing-livestream-software-the-obs-vs-streamlabs-dilemma-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Choosing Livestream Software The OBS Vs.

Use <strong>Microsoft speech to text</strong> service. This service was launched in 2020 alongside the text-to-speech service, which includes famous computer-generated voices like <strong>Microsoft Sam</strong> and his brother, Mike. So, in this short read, you’ll learn what <strong>Microsoft Azure speech to text</strong> service is and its capabilities. I’ll also introduce you to the best Microsoft Azure STT alternatives. Let’s hunker down!</p><p><strong>Top Alternative to Microsoft Azure STT</strong> Save plenty of time on transcribing subtitles and boost your editing efficiency by applying Filmora Speech-To-Text.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try STT Now <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try STT Now <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Explore STT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/banner/filmora-latest-product-box.png"                      alt="Wondershare Filmora"                ></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Microsoft-Azure-and-Speech-Studio"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Microsoft-Azure-and-Speech-Studio" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Microsoft Azure and Speech Studio?"></a>Part 1: What is Microsoft Azure and Speech Studio?</h2><p>Microsoft Azure STT and TTS are part of <strong>Microsoft Cognitive Services Speech</strong>. These cognitive services feature state-of-the-art intelligence covering voice recognition, speaker recognition, machine translation, and OCR (Optical Character Recognition). The Microsoft speech to text service uses Azure Machine Learning (Azure ML) to auto-recognize, analyze, and convert human voices to editable and searchable texts.</p><p>Having said that, Azure STT lets you transcribe streaming audio, microphone commentary, or local audio files. It supports 100+ languages, including English, German, French, Swahili, Hindi, Ukrainian, Turkish, Arabic, and more. Remember that this service also supports batch transcription, allowing you to transcribe multiple audios in batch.</p><p>In the meantime, Azure STT is available in many formats, including Speech SDK. Speech SDK (Software Development Kit) allows you to use popular programming languages to create a speech-enabled application. It’s compatible with Java, JavaScript, Python, Visual Studio C++, Swift, and Objective-C.</p><p>If you’re not good with programming languages, use Speech CLI, a command tool that allows you to use the speech recognition service without entering a code. Put simply, it features a minimal setup with precise requirements. Plus, it features pretty much everything you’ll find in Speech SDK. So, it depends on your skills and preference.</p><p>It is also worth noting that Azure Speech Studio supports keyword recognition or keyword spotting. You can generate keyword recognition models and specify any short phrase or word. Users can also personalize keywords with the correct punctuations. And best of all, there is no extra cost for customizing keywords.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Transcribe-Speech-to-Text-with-Microsoft-Speech-Studio"><a href="#Part-2-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Transcribe-Speech-to-Text-with-Microsoft-Speech-Studio" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Step by Step Guide to Transcribe Speech to Text with Microsoft Speech Studio"></a>Part 2: Step by Step Guide to Transcribe Speech to Text with Microsoft Speech Studio</h2><p>Now let’s learn how to use Microsoft Azure speech recognition services. Remember, the conversion may not be accurate if the audio has lots of domain-industry jargon or ambient noises. Therefore, use crisp-clear audio with an external mic or train the software to recognize specific words or keywords. Let’s get started!</p><p>Step1Start by creating a Microsoft Azure account. You’ll start with the free version, which gives you a <strong>$200 credit to use within 30 days</strong>. After depleting the free credits, use the pay-as-you-go model, which unlocks 40+ Azure services.</p><p>Step2After creating a Microsoft Azure portal, you’ll see all Azure services. Click the Speech Services tab or search for “speech services” on the search bar. Now click Create and then fill out the project details. Then, click Review and Create before clicking Create.</p><p>Step3The program will take a while to deploy an instance. Now tap Keys and endpoints on the left pane and copy the key and region identifier as you may need them later on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/microsoft-speech-to-text-1.jpg"                      alt="micrsoft azure speech to text copy key and region"                ></p><p>Step4Download and install Microsoft Visual C++ and .NET Core 3.1 Runtime. Next, install Speech CL on .NET by running this command “**dotnet tool install -global Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech.CLI.**” Alternatively, download and install Speech CLI for Windows PCs as a <a class="link"   href="https://aka.ms/speech/spx-windows" >ZIP file <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Step5Now enter the Azure regional identifier and subscription key on Windows Terminal or PowerShell. To configure the region and key, run these commands; “<strong>spx config @key –set SUBSCRIPTION-KEY</strong> and **spx config @region –set REGION.**”</p><p>Step6Now it’s time to convert speech to text using Azure STT Service. To do that, run “<strong>spx recognize -microphone</strong>” on Terminal or PowerShell. Azure Speech CLI will listen to sound input and convert it to text. And there is that!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"                      alt="icon note"                ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Click <a class="link"   href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/shows/one-dev-minute/how-to-use-the-azure-cognitive-services-net-speech-sdk-for-recognition" >this video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for a detailed guide on how to use Azure Speech Services with Visual Basic (SDK).</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9wiIVztRIqQ?si=GBgdwQ78k5hbeFDv&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-What-Are-the-Free-Alternatives-to-the-Microsoft-Speech-to-Text-Service"><a href="#Part-3-What-Are-the-Free-Alternatives-to-the-Microsoft-Speech-to-Text-Service" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What Are the Free Alternatives to the Microsoft Speech to Text Service?"></a>Part 3: What Are the Free Alternatives to the Microsoft Speech to Text Service?</h2><p>We should all agree that using Microsoft Azures Speech Service is not a walk in the park. You need some knowledge of programming and Windows Command Prompt. Even worse, you’ll have to pay each time you want to convert speech to text after depleting the free credits.</p><p>Fortunately, there’s no shortage of free speech to text converters for beginners. So, in this part, we’ll discuss some free Microsoft Azure STT alternatives for beginners.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UJJbj1vbzs8?si=X3zd8thLJKprfuEa&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#1-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="1.

It’s a video editor for creating award-winning videos without prior editing skills. Just upload your local video and edit it as you please. And yes, it works with a host of video formats.</p><p>When you want to make perfect videos, you can use Filmora’s STT feature. Wondershare Filmora Speech to Text is quite different with other STT service providers. Other STT platforms&#x2F;stages require you to use the application to convert speech-to-text, save, and export into other third-party software. However, Wondershare Filmora allows you to directly convert your speech-to-text on an ongoing production. For example, you can convert speech into subtitles during a video production on Wondershare Filmora.</p><p>What’s more, now Filmora’s STT feature supports direct transcription of bilingual subtitles with up to 27 languages of transcription in Filmora.</p><h3 id="Top-Adavantages-of-Filmora-STT"><a href="#Top-Adavantages-of-Filmora-STT" class="headerlink" title="Top Adavantages of Filmora STT"></a>Top Adavantages of Filmora STT</h3><ul><li>Supports direct transcription of bilingual subtitles.</li><li>Allows to transcribe video speech to text in one click.</li><li>Boosts editing efficiency by applying the STT feature.</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Make STT Videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Make STT Videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><h3 id="Use-Filmora-To-Make-STT-videos"><a href="#Use-Filmora-To-Make-STT-videos" class="headerlink" title="Use Filmora To Make STT videos"></a>Use Filmora To Make STT videos</h3><h5 id="Step-1"><a href="#Step-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 1"></a>Step 1</h5><p>Select the audio asset in the timeline, and click the “Speech-to-Text” icon in the toolbar; if there is no supported file type on the timeline, it will not be displayed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/guide-win/toolbar-stt.jpg"                      alt="toolbar stt"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S0b9szh8vEk?si=NlGzpJ6MN_SJNk5A&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h5 id="Step-2"><a href="#Step-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 2"></a>Step 2</h5><p>Click the “Speech-to-Text” icon, and it will show the parameter settings.

Most of you may not be aware that Google Docs can accurately convert speech to text. This makes it a handy tool if you find speaking easier than writing. As expected, this voice transcription tool recognizes hundreds of languages, like English, French, Italian, Hindi, etc.</p><p>But although it does a commendable job, less-than-clear audio won’t give you accurate transcriptions. Also, it doesn’t feature niceties like periods, commas, and other punctuations. As such, stick to a professional app like Filmora to transcribe your audio to text.</p><p>Steps to convert voice to text with Google Docs:</p><p>Step1Open a new document on Google Docs and then click Voice typing. The inbuilt microphone will automatically launch.</p><p>Step2Next, click the language drop-down arrow on the microphone to choose the transcription language. You can dictate texts in English, Espanol, French, Italian, Afrikaans, Arabic, and more.</p><p>Step3Click the Microphone icon to start dictating texts on Google Docs. After dictating enough texts, tap the red Microphone icon and edit your text.

It’s a highly rated online program that uses cutting-edge machine learning technology to transcribe audio to text in 60+ languages. You can easily train this program to identify the speaker in your interview or podcast file.</p><p>Meanwhile, Audtext can transcribe typical video and audio formats, including MP3, WAV, M4A, MP4, MOV, and more. And after transcribing audio to text, exploit the inbuilt text editor to retouch and make your text presentable.</p><p>Let’s find out how this STT service works:</p><p>Step1Create a transcription account on Audtext and click New Upload to choose the transcription mode. You can select the automatic transcription that uses AI or professional real-human transcription. So, let’s choose Automatic.</p><p>Step2Drag-n-drop your video or audio file on the program and then choose the transcription language. After adding your file, click Upload to scan and transcribe it. This should take a while.</p><p>Step3Finally, click the transcribed text file to edit it with new texts and punctuations on the inbuilt editor. You can export your transcription in .txt, .srt, or .docx formats. Directly export to Google Drive is also available.</p><h2 id="Final-Words"><a href="#Final-Words" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h2><p>Up to this point, you should be ready to get started with the <strong>Microsoft Cognitive Services Speech</strong>. The speech-to-text feature allows you to convert unlimited voices to text on your computer.

There are 2 ways of creating time-lapse videos with GoPro:</p><ol><li>Record a still photo sequence on your action camera and then compile it later on your computer.</li><li>Leave the task of compiling to your action camera to get an MP4 video.</li></ol><p>The in-camera version, also known as the time lapse video mode, is present only in GoPro Hero4 and Hero5 series. For other GoPro models, it is necessary to use a software to compile images and video clips. The GoPro Studio, which developed by GoPro, is an ideal video editing software which allows you to create nicely edited time-lapse videos. In this article, we will show you how to create a time lapse video with images and clips in GoPro Studio.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Create Timelapse videos from Videos</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Create Timelapse videos from Images</a></li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2Iv3DjT2Fyw?si=pR_z8ZDDVGF2MvKJ&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Create-GoPro-Studio-Time-Lapse-Videos-from-Images"><a href="#Create-GoPro-Studio-Time-Lapse-Videos-from-Images" class="headerlink" title="Create GoPro Studio Time Lapse Videos from Images"></a>Create GoPro Studio Time Lapse Videos from Images</h2><h4 id="1-Import-Images"><a href="#1-Import-Images" class="headerlink" title="1. Import Images"></a><strong>1. Import Images</strong></h4><p>The first thing you have to do is import your images. This can be done by clicking File &gt; Import Media or click Import New Files on the left panel. Ideally you need to keep all your photos in a single folder and name them according to sequence. This would instantly pick up the image sequence when you click on the first file. Then the software will create a reference video automatically, which may take a couple of seconds.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Learn How to shoot a time-lapse video with GoPro Hero5 Black <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-gopro-studio.jpg"                      alt="GoPro Studio Import"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aqeO4ed766s?si=AWtKHxP4hvQRd_lk&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h4 id="2-Select-the-Clips"><a href="#2-Select-the-Clips" class="headerlink" title="2. Select the Clips"></a><strong>2. Select the Clips</strong></h4><p>The reference video would be imported by GoPro Studio. Go to Import New Files and click the video to add it to the central window. When you click the Play button, you can watch the time-lapse played at approximately 30 fps. In the left hand corner of the bottom you can see the Advanced Setting button. By adjusting these settings you will be able to select your desired frame rate. There are also other options like Quality setting, Motion Blur and the Speedup option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/advanced-settings-gopro-studio.jpg"                      alt="GoPro Studio Advanced Settings"                ></p><h4 id="3-Convert"><a href="#3-Convert" class="headerlink" title="3. Convert"></a><strong>3. Convert</strong></h4><p>The clip is automatically queued at the conversion list. While adding more than one clip just repeat the process to add them to your conversion list panel. Now you just need to click the convert button, and all the sequences would be converted into a ready-to-edit video file. It might take some time depending on how many clips you have. You will see a preview in a tiny thumbnail while it’s processing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-video-with-gopro-studio-4.jpg"                      alt="GoPro Studio Conversion"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S3Th6oa_isA?si=TTQ013BB9beUM4x6&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h4 id="4-Edit"><a href="#4-Edit" class="headerlink" title="4. Edit"></a><strong>4. Edit</strong></h4><p>Once the conversion is done, you need to click on Proceed to Next Stage which would take you to the edit panel. Now drag the videos from the media window and place them on the timeline just under the centre window. The video can be edited here and the speed can be altered in the right hand window by unfolding the video and dragging the speed slider. The framing can also be altered so that you can select how much of the image you want to show.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-interface-gopro-studio.jpg"                      alt="GoPro Studio Edit Interface"                ></p><h4 id="5-Export"><a href="#5-Export" class="headerlink" title="5. Export"></a><strong>5. Export</strong></h4><p>If you are trying to find the easiest way to export a basic time-lapse footage then you can do away with the storyboard panel. If the basic settings don’t bother you, then just click the Export button. A new browser window would open, where you can name the file to be exported and select the location where you want to save. You can even select the setting at which you want it exported. You will find optimized settings for Vimeo and YouTube, and you can even do the setting individually by going to the Custom option.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Learn more in Complete Guide to Edit a Video with GoPro Studio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MPoakxUNf9o?si=S-ppSqzHzN9VrxC7&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Create-GoPro-timelapse-video-from-Video-Clips"><a href="#Create-GoPro-timelapse-video-from-Video-Clips" class="headerlink" title="Create GoPro timelapse video from Video Clips"></a>Create GoPro timelapse video from Video Clips</h2><p>You can also choose to make a time-lapse video with the help of the video clips shot on your action camera.</p><p>After importing and converting your videos, go to the Edit section and drag the speed slider under the Video menu on the right hand panel. Generally 100% is the normal speed but you can always increase the number for a higher speed.</p><p>However, importing your video clips to GoPro Studio is a rather time taking process which is going to test your patience.

With Filmora, you will be able to import a video as large as 8GB in just 2 minutes, and the trim and merge feature would allow you to use certain specific frames without any loss in quality. The Filmora editing software would also allow you to speed up the video clips, so that you can speed up the trimmed no quality loss clips to make a wonderful time lapse video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/speed-effect-speed-add-marker.png"                      alt="Speed up interface"                ></p><p>Check this video to know more about what can Filmora do with your GoPro footages</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a class="link"   href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg" >Download Mac Version <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>](<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fvAC8jgs62o?si=xqEXZ7dpAXZ4sZ7A&autoplay=1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-squeezing-light-from-iphone-nocturnes/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Squeezing Light From iPhone Nocturnes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/new-editors-picks-top-budget-friendly-online-tools/"><u>[New] Editor's Picks Top Budget-Friendly Online Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/new-elevating-positivity-in-a-constructive-space/"><u>[New] Elevating Positivity in a Constructive Space</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-techniques-for-immaculate-vr-gaming-footage/"><u>[New] Techniques for Immaculate VR Gaming Footage</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-shadow-broadcasters-master-the-art-of-anonymous-livestreaming-on-instagram/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Shadow Broadcasters Master the Art of Anonymous Livestreaming on Instagram</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-ultimate-seal-on-cyberspace-expeditions/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Ultimate Seal on Cyberspace Expeditions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/ed-harmonizing-youtube-content-with-audio-files/"><u>[Updated] Harmonizing YouTube Content with Audio Files</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-creating-a-seamless-visual-experience-in-meetings/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Creating a Seamless Visual Experience in Meetings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-tips-for-removing-fisheye-from-gopro-footage/"><u>[Updated] Tips for Removing Fisheye From GoPro Footage</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/in-2024-optimal-websites-to-increase-youtube-views/"><u>In 2024, Optimal Websites to Increase YouTube Views</u></a></li><li><a href="https://hardware-tips.techidaily.com/navigating-the-best-gadgets-insights-from-toms-hardware/"><u>Navigating the Best Gadgets: Insights From Tom's Hardware</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/pokemon-go-error-12-failed-to-detect-location-on-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Pokemon Go Error 12 Failed to Detect Location On Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5?

We may listen to songs on our computers and occasionally hear good radio and radio stations.
