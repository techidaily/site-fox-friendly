With compact goggles you will be getting a lightweight goggle that should fit snuggles to your head and give you two small screens. While with the Box goggles you will have a large LCD screen (allowing for a better view,) however, they tend to be a little more heavy than the compact FPV goggles.</p><p><strong>Aspect Ratio:</strong> Your drone’s FPV camera come in one of two aspect ratios - 16:9 or 4:3. This means it is absolutely crucial to make sure that you grab a paid of FPV goggles that match that aspect ratio. If you mix and match aspect ratios yo will end up with an image that is squashed or stretched out. While you may think you could get used to the skewed view, it takes away from the precision (and point) of having a FPV goggle when drone racing.</p><p><strong>Field of View:</strong> Each set of FPV goggles comes with their own Field of View (FOV.) This means each pair of goggles has its own degree to which the edge of the viewing screen is angled from your eyes. The higher the FOV a goggle has the better your picture quality will be.</p><p><strong>Head Tracking:</strong> When it comes to drone racing, you will want to make sure you have a FPV goggle that has a high head tracking ratio. Head tracking allows for a truly immersive experience because it relates to the ability of your on-board camera motion to bind with your head motion (meaning the camera moves smoothly and accurately in relation to how you move your head as the pilot.)</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"

This model is designed to be a high-caliber Pro selection and a regular use work monitor that has all of the specs necessary for a variety of digital work tasks. If you are looking for a top quality 32-inch monitor for the use of everyday working tasks the UHD 4k monitor is near the top of many pro designers lists.</p><p><strong>Pros and Cons</strong></p><p> Overall this is a monitor that brings extensive value due to its LCD construction includes professional calibration software, and improved build quality, excellent styling for matching almost any office as well as an improved bright IPS panel, image quality, and Ultra HD resolutions.</p><p> The biggest problems that face this monitor are definitely the OSD calibration which is extremely inflexible; what’s more, the software which does not support the use of high-end instruments or even PC sharing with one keyboard and mouse. Other top-quality professional monitors do include the use of these features but they are also considerably more expensive.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Asus-PA-329Q-Design-Quality"><a href="#Asus-PA-329Q-Design-Quality" class="headerlink" title="Asus PA 329Q Design Quality"></a>Asus PA 329Q Design Quality</h2><h4 id="1-Design-Style"><a href="#1-Design-Style" class="headerlink" title="1.Design Style"></a>1.Design Style</h4><p> The overall design of this device includes a 360° rotation for portrait mode, a sturdy and unique stand as well as a height adjustable operation. This is the type of monitor that you can use for ergonomic support day in and day out. The overall design style is made from modern office and it can be made to fit in almost any environment. Including eight ergonomic swivel, pivot, height adjustment and more is an ideal choice for many professionals who are looking for a monitor that they can use for preventing neck strain and improving long working hours each day.</p><p> The look of this monitor also comes with a beautiful logo that improves the branding of the monitor as well as strong materials all finished in matte black. This matte black construction really helps to improve the look of the monitor overall and to make sure that it can fade into almost any office setting. The cabinet finish features a 10 mm bezel which is not too distracting and ensures that if multiple monitors needed to be used for one workstation this could be done quite easily. Overall the monitor size is great and with the design of the adjustments it’s really easy to enjoy a functional design that goes far beyond the average 32 inch television or large display. The comfort adjustments on this make it perfect for professionals.</p><p> The stand and base are manufactured and extremely minimalist design which is functional yet extremely strong and study. This ensures that the entire unit can stand up quite well in a large office or across many cubicles and hours of work. The PA329Q is known for being adjustable in every way that an ASUS is providing for all of its 4 k monitors. If you have used one of these monitors in the past they can be extremely comfortable over long uses making them ideal for a workplace setting.</p><h4 id="2-Ports-and-Connectivity"><a href="#2-Ports-and-Connectivity" class="headerlink" title="2. Ports and Connectivity"></a>2. Ports and Connectivity</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/asus-proart-pa329q-ports.jpg"                      alt="asus-proart-pa329q-ports"                ></p><p> The PA 329Q has almost any type of port that you might require in a workplace including four HDMI version 2.0 ports, mini display port 1.2 a standard display port 1.2 as well as five USB 3.0 ports, a nine in one card reader as well as an earphone jack.</p><p> Most of these ports are located directly underneath the monitor, and the only problem with this is that it can often lead to troubles with cord management. While most of the ports can be easily viewed by tilting the monitor, sometimes it can be difficult to plug items in for connectivity without first raising the monitor up or even tilting it all the way down. Once you have the monitor configured and everything plugged in, it’s quite easy to use for day to day operations.</p><p> The overall design of the ports and the location of these ports is for a minimalist design with the look of many items, such as cords and empty ports hidden away from view. Most of the settings and button features can be found along the side of the monitor where they can sometimes be hidden from view. When using the monitor in portrait mode these ports become much more accessible. For most high-end monitors, these types of ports are expected but it’s tough to find too many monitors that have such a wealth of ports available for use at one time.</p><h2 id="Features-and-Performance"><a href="#Features-and-Performance" class="headerlink" title="Features and Performance"></a>Features and Performance</h2><h4 id="1-OSD-and-Settings"><a href="#1-OSD-and-Settings" class="headerlink" title="1.OSD and Settings"></a>1.OSD and Settings</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/asus-proart-pa329q-osd.jpg"                      alt="asus-proart-pa329q-osd"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2049378/7443" target="_top" id="2049378">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2049378" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2049378/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> The overall settings are handled by joystick navigation through the large OSD. There are many color options including quick fit resolution, a full menu of color options, input selections, blue light filters calibration tools and more. For the most part, calibration can be done with splendid menus which are available just out of the box. Additional features can also be found throughout the menu to improve connectivity and the use of the menus throughout usage. There is even an option to create alignments based off of actual paper sizes so that you can create very precise editing and proofing on documents before they print.</p><p> There are eight different picture modes available throughout the settings including sRBG, Adobe RPG and a variety of other factory settings. Putting locks into the brightness as well as color can make sure that full adjustments stay through multiple shifts and working conditions. Blue light filters also come with four different options ensuring that you can get compensation based off of the types of color settings you work best with. The color menu adjustments include sliders for all six colors and under the advanced submenu, there are some fine tuning adjustments that you won’t find on many other types of professional monitors.</p><p> The remaining types of picture controls can be found throughout the image submenu which allows for adjustments in sharpness, overscan, aspect control toggles and more. The Vivid Pixel enhancement option also allows for improved contrast between dark and light objects across the screen. The dynamic feature will improve the range of shadows for animation work for example.</p><h4 id="2-Color-and-Image-Quality"><a href="#2-Color-and-Image-Quality" class="headerlink" title="2.

There are color spaces for video editing in 2020 as well as true to life color reproduction.</p><p> What’s really incredible with the color and image quality is the full customization that is available to professionals. Through the menus, it’s possible to change brightness settings, calibrate for animation and improved contrast as well as deliver improved support for working within Adobe and other video editing and production suites.</p><p> This device can produce 1.0 7 billion colors with the chance to produce over 1024 shades of each primary color. The screen is made up of a 10-bit panel and there is a 14-bit lookup table for a huge color gamut. There is also amazing gamma correction and color recalculation to represent the differences between colors and to finally produce a true to life image based off of the closest specifications and measurements on a print product.</p><p> Overall the image quality and color quality is perfect especially when the settings are dialed in the only aspect where this monitor falls short however is with brightness uniformity. Even many of the top Asus monitors find difficulty with uniformity compensation throughout the monitor face and this makes brightness at a fixed level of premium. The pure resolution and the size of the monitor ensures that pixels are close to invisible and the antiglare matte coating on the monitor makes it easy to read and easy to see colors in a variety of different lighting settings.</p><h4 id="3-Calibration"><a href="#3-Calibration" class="headerlink" title="3.

For example, the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) mandates all member states to harmonize their data privacy laws. In addition, it requires organizations to issue you a privacy notice that is transparent, concise, and easily accessible. Unfortunately, companies like Facebook continue to face criticism for breaching these laws through features like Off Facebook Previews.</p><p>If you are unfamiliar with the feature, the following information is extremely useful. As you keep reading, you will discover what “off Facebook preview” is and how it affects your data protection. Furthermore, there is a detailed guide on how to deactivate the feature in your account.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part1-What-is-Off-Facebook-Preview"><a href="#Part1-What-is-Off-Facebook-Preview" class="headerlink" title="Part1: What is Off-Facebook Preview?"></a>Part1: What is Off-Facebook Preview?</h2><p>Off-Facebook Previews are a record of all your activities outside the platform.

For example, your local retailer can submit your search history to Facebook if their website uses some of their technology to run it.</li><li>A record of all apps and websites where you use your Facebook credentials to log in. Typically, the information comes from companies offering Facebook Login as one of their single sign-on (SSO) methods.</li><li>Your donation and content viewing activity from companies that use Facebook API in their websites and apps.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1915830/19272" target="_top" id="1915830">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1915830" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1915830/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part2-Should-I-Leave-Off-Facebook-Activity-be-on-or-off"><a href="#Part2-Should-I-Leave-Off-Facebook-Activity-be-on-or-off" class="headerlink" title="Part2: Should I Leave Off Facebook Activity be on or off?"></a>Part2: Should I Leave Off Facebook Activity be on or off?</h2><p>As you can see, Off Facebook Previews collects lots of your sensitive information from its clients.

In addition, it further emphasizes this through its Privacy Policy, and the <a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/off%5Ffacebook%5Factivity" >What is off-Facebook activity <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li>In addition, the company strictly prohibits its clients from sharing sensitive information through the Off-Facebook Previews feature. Some of the sensitive information it prohibits includes your medical history, financial information, birthday, and user credentials.</li><li>Furthermore, any organization using Facebook’s business tools must clearly state this information with their clients before activating their subscription. Failure to do so can lead to immediate service discontinuation or legal liability in extreme cases.</li><li>Moreover, the company allows you to manage your Off-Facebook activity directly from your profile. For example, you can use the Clear Previous activity option to erase all previous data or use the Disconnect Future activity function to prevent further data collection.</li><li>Finally, the company openly shares a record of the information it receives from its clients through the <strong>Recent Activity</strong> Please refer to the <strong>What is Off-Facebook Preview</strong> section to discover what user information the company shares in your recent activity report.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1868571/19272" target="_top" id="1868571">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1868571" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1868571/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="FAQs"><a href="#FAQs" class="headerlink" title="FAQs"></a>FAQs</h2><h4 id="Is-the-Off-Facebook-Previews-feature-safe"><a href="#Is-the-Off-Facebook-Previews-feature-safe" class="headerlink" title="Is the Off-Facebook Previews feature safe?"></a>Is the Off-Facebook Previews feature safe?</h4><p>Not in its current state. Here are some of the reasons for this stance.</p><ul><li>It takes 48 hours for Facebook to disconnect you from the service fully. This gives them ample time to collect more personal information from you to further their business interests.</li><li>You will continue receiving ads from Facebook clients even when you deactivate the feature successfully. This is because the social media platform continues to collect your personal data if your account is active. For example, third-party advertisers can show you campaigns based on your Facebook group likes and interests.</li><li>You will need to create a new account for apps and websites where you used Facebook SSO. This is because disabling Off-Facebook Previews automatically signs you out from these accounts.</li><li>Despite several punishments from law enforcement, Facebook continues to face criticism for its poor data security protocols. For example, the company is issuing checks of up to $397 to its users, following an <a class="link"   href="https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/did-you-receive-a-illinois-facebook-settlement-check-in-the-mail-heres-why-and-what-to-know-about-it/2839499/" >agreement with the Illinois State Settlement Administrator for data privacy violations. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h4 id="Can-you-deactivate-Off-Facebook-Previews-for-specific-websites-and-apps"><a href="#Can-you-deactivate-Off-Facebook-Previews-for-specific-websites-and-apps" class="headerlink" title="Can you deactivate Off-Facebook Previews for specific websites and apps?"></a>Can you deactivate Off-Facebook Previews for specific websites and apps?</h4><p>Yes, you can disable your future off-Facebook activity for specific apps. Here is how you do it:</p><ol><li>Log in to your Facebook account, and choose <strong>Settings and Privacy</strong> from your profile picture drop-down menu.</li><li>Tap on the <strong>Settings</strong> option, and choose <strong>Privacy</strong> from the resulting menu.</li><li>Then, select the <strong>Off-Facebook Activity</strong>, followed by <strong>Explore Activity</strong>, on the next page.</li><li>Finalize the process by clicking the <strong>Select Future Activity to Disconnect</strong> button.</li></ol><h4 id="Do-you-need-to-repeat-the-process-for-different-platform-devices"><a href="#Do-you-need-to-repeat-the-process-for-different-platform-devices" class="headerlink" title="Do you need to repeat the process for different platform devices?"></a>Do you need to repeat the process for different platform devices?</h4><p>No. Facebook is a cross-platform program, meaning the changes apply to all devices you have access to. So, for example, Off-Facebook Previews will still be inactive on your desktop even when you make the change using your smartphone.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-gimbal-excellence-markets-top-choices/"><u>[New] In 2024, Gimbal Excellence Market's Top Choices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-ultimate-360-view-camera-analysis/"><u>[New] In 2024, Ultimate 360-View Camera Analysis</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-mastering-iphone-autofocusing-a-guide-for-users-for-2024/"><u>[New] Mastering iPhone Autofocusing A Guide for Users for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/new-step-by-step-tutorial-for-effective-morphvox-audio-changes-for-2024/"><u>[New] Step-by-Step Tutorial for Effective MorphVOX Audio Changes for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-unveiling-iphones-secret-life-after-the-shot-for-2024/"><u>[New] Unveiling iPhone's Secret Life After the Shot for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-discovering-different-facets-of-ar-stickers-a-focus-on-google/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Discovering Different Facets of AR Stickers A Focus on Google</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/updated-beat-hopping-boundaries-linking-service-playlists-together-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Beat Hopping Boundaries Linking Service Playlists Together for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/updated-upgrading-effortlessly-with-a-focus-on-key-lens-features/"><u>[Updated] Upgrading Effortlessly with a Focus on Key Lens Features</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/44cm5yuv55s75yqg5bel44gu44k544og44od44ox44ki44od44ox77ya44or44ov44o844od44kk44oz44oi44gn44ot44oh44kq44ks5rsx57e044gv44gb44klic0g57wq5zci44gl44kj5zue6lui44gp70/"><u>「動画加工のステップアップ：パワーポイントでビデオを洗練させる - 結合から回転まで」</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/2024-approved-heartfelt-cheers-access-to-free-and-paid-otu-ideas/"><u>2024 Approved Heartfelt Cheers Access to Free & Paid OTU Ideas</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/2024-approved-how-to-make-gmail-meetings-work-zipping-up-zoom-integrations/"><u>2024 Approved How to Make Gmail Meetings Work Zipping Up Zoom Integrations</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/approved-tips-for-seamlessly-adding-youtube-to-your-gslides-deck/"><u>2024 Approved Tips for Seamlessly Adding YouTube to Your GSlides Deck</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/2024-approved-unaltered-audio-through-the-lens-of-ffmpeg-review/"><u>2024 Approved Unaltered Audio Through the Lens of FFmpeg Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/shared-sights-untold-histories-revealed-for-2024/"><u>Shared Sights Untold Histories Revealed for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/top-windows-8-tools-for-flawless-display-captures/"><u>Top Windows 8 Tools for Flawless Display Captures</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

If you are a beginner and finding trouble in your selection process then the article below will help you to narrow down your list of preferences. There is no need to pay for features that you don’t even want to use, simple pick the suitable and useful tools for your needs and enjoy your live streams with friends.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Consider-the-CDN"><a href="#Consider-the-CDN" class="headerlink" title="Consider the CDN"></a>Consider the CDN</h2><p> Here, CDN is an abbreviation for Content Delivery Network.</p><h3 id="Speed-Matters"><a href="#Speed-Matters" class="headerlink" title="Speed Matters"></a>Speed Matters</h3><p> When we talk about video streaming then speed plays major role. Size of video files use to be much larger as compared to other data files so they demand faster internet connection for transfers otherwise you may face an error. Now as during live streaming process, data is transmitted on real time basis so users cannot recover the losses in between. Direct video streaming from a server is easier only when you have to focus upon localized area or small number of viewers.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2111981/7443" target="_top" id="2111981">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2111981" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2111981/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="CDNs-offer-reliability-and-speed"><a href="#CDNs-offer-reliability-and-speed" class="headerlink" title="CDNs offer reliability and speed"></a>CDNs offer reliability and speed</h3><p> This speed issue is well treated by CDNs. Actually, CDN acts like a global network where all servers are linked together. During CDN based streaming, the data is automatically copied and transferred over all available servers. All viewers will be able to access videos from servers that appear closest to their location. Hence, overall speed gets maximized and the buffering issue is eliminated. With the distributed CDN network, it becomes possible to share huge load over server and millions of viewers can stay tuned at a time.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2130531/26400" target="_top" id="2130531">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2130531" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2130531/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Ease-of-Use"><a href="#Ease-of-Use" class="headerlink" title="Ease of Use"></a>Ease of Use</h2><p> There is no doubt to say that streaming is a highly complex technology.

It delivers brilliantly on some key features visual professionals want including an impressive 31.5-inch display, an IPS LCD, HDR 10 support, high-level color accuracy and depth, and the latest in DisplayPort technology.</p><p> The BenQ SW320 monitor started making waves long before it hit the market. That’s because it proposed to offer premium visual rendering functionality for a quarter of the price of its nearest high-end competitor. At roughly $1500, the SW320 is a steal for visual professionals who are keen to improve their workflow while remaining on the cutting edge of their practice.</p><p> Its 3840 x 2160px 4K display does require a powerful graphics processor to reach peak performance. The good news is that the cost of high-level graphic processing is on a downward trajectory. With a top performing monitor like the BenQ SW320, professional photographers, videographers and graphic artists can work with colors and details that are on par with nature’s artistry and their lofty creative aspirations.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="BenQ-SW320-4K-Monitor-Pros-and-Cons"><a href="#BenQ-SW320-4K-Monitor-Pros-and-Cons" class="headerlink" title="BenQ SW320 4K Monitor Pros and Cons"></a>BenQ SW320 4K Monitor Pros and Cons</h2><p> This monitor has many positives to tally. The most notable has to be its state-of-the-art input port technologies. It sports an HDMI 2.0 port, a DisplayPort 1.4 and a mini DisplayPort 1.4. These input sockets have the necessary bandwidth to support its 4k UHD screen, its high-fidelity color renditions and its HDR functionality.</p><p> Also worthy of note is its effective stand which lets users adjust the positioning of the screen for best viewing results. On its stand, the BenQ SW320 monitor can make a 20-degree upward tilt, a 45-degree right or left swivel, and a 90-degree pivot from landscape to portrait mode.</p><p> The swivel feature does fall short of what professional studio designers may require. A photographer who needs to swivel the monitor to show a colleague her work may find a 45-degree swivel insufficient.</p><p> Another significant downside has to do with uniformity across its screen. According to some testers, the SW320 shows noticeable color tints towards the edges when set to display all-white. This is perceptible even when its Brightness Uniformity feature is enabled. While uniformity is something most monitors fail to achieve 100%, it’s not out of place to expect that a monitor as powerful and as groundbreaking as the BenQ SW320 would succeed where others have not.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137226/26400" target="_top" id="2137226">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137226" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137226/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Hardware-Design"><a href="#Hardware-Design" class="headerlink" title="Hardware Design"></a>Hardware Design</h2><h4 id="1-Design-Style"><a href="#1-Design-Style" class="headerlink" title="1.Design Style"></a>1.Design Style</h4><p> The design of the BenQ SW320 is ideal for Professional photographers. It has a minimal black finish with an optimal bezel size and a matte screen surface that minimizes harsh glare.</p><p> The SW320 also has the right support apparatus. As mentioned above, it ships with a very efficient stand that provides ample support for its relatively heavy bulk. It is also a VESA compatible monitor. This means that it has standardized slots designed to let it be mounted on a wall.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benq-sw320-hotkey-puck-button.jpg"                      alt="benq-sw320-hotkey-puck-button"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1902324/19272" target="_top" id="1902324">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1902324" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1902324/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> The most novel design feature of the SW320 is the remote-control Puck which stows seamlessly in a round slot located at the base of its stand. The puck connects to the back of the monitor and is a great convenience utility. It has the right size and bulk to fit effortlessly into any visual professional’s workflow while providing quick access to OSD menus.</p><p> With so much going for it, the BenQ SW320 has yet another functional tool many pros are sure to appreciate. It comes with a Monitor Shading Hood that blocks stray light from altering the color accuracy of images on its screen.</p><h4 id="2-Ports-and-Connectivity"><a href="#2-Ports-and-Connectivity" class="headerlink" title="2. Ports and Connectivity"></a>2. Ports and Connectivity</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benq-sw320-ports.jpg"                      alt="benq-sw320-ports"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144275/7443" target="_top" id="2144275">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144275" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144275/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> As discussed earlier, the SW320 is fitted with the latest input port technologies. Its HDMI 2.O port, Display port 1.4 and mini DisplayPort 1.4 are located at the lower back side of the monitor. It also has a 3.5mm headphone jack and an AC power cable slot also located at its lower back side. The HDMI 2.0 port enables HDR support while the DisplayPort 1.4 enables full 10-bit color displays. To access these ports conveniently, users need only swivel the monitor slightly in the clockwise direction until the input panel is plainly in view.</p><p> In addition to having the right input slots to support its high-level visual performance, the SW320 also has 2 USB 3.0 slots and one SD Card slot located on its left side. BenQ takes the guesswork out of using these input slots correctly by supplying the right cables. Furthermore, there’s a cable management hole built into its stand that makes keeping a tidy set up very easy.</p><h2 id="Features-and-Performance"><a href="#Features-and-Performance" class="headerlink" title="Features and Performance"></a>Features and Performance</h2><h4 id="1-Color-Performance"><a href="#1-Color-Performance" class="headerlink" title="1. Color Performance"></a>1. Color Performance</h4><p> High-level color performance is a major strong suit of the BenQ SW320. When it comes to the number of colors it can render, this monitor packs a powerful punch. It can display a staggering 1.07 billion colors in multiple color gamuts. It is also Technicolor certified for both color accuracy and consistency.</p><p> It supports 10-bit color display and a 14-bit color LUT, and can render 99% of the sRGB color gamut as well as 99% of the AdobeRGB color gamut. Its coverage of the AdobeRGB gamut is particularly significant because AdobeRGB has an extended blue and green gamut compared to sRGB. As a result, AdobeRGB is better at rendering colors from nature.</p><p> AdobeRGB and sRGB aside, this monitor also has additional built-in color modes such as Black and White, DCI-P3, HDR and CAD&#x2F;CAM.</p><p> What’s really impressive is how easy it is to compare images in 2 color modes on the SW320. With Picture-in-Picture and Picture-by-Picture settings, a professional photographer can compare images in different color modes side-by-side. Enabling the PIP&#x2F;PBP feature through the HotKey Puck or joystick activates BenQ’s proprietary GamutDuo. GamutDuo is the feature which supports this on-screen color-mode comparison feature.</p><p> The SW320’s HDR support is another remarkable color performance feature. High Dynamic Rate support makes it possible to render more colors in the black and white range. It’s an all-important feature of High-Definition TVs. With this feature, the SW320 can achieve picture brilliance on par with HD-TV sets and other screens designed for entertainment purposes. This level of image quality enables professionals to produce top-quality work while also advancing the realm of possibility for their craft.</p><h4 id="2-Calibration"><a href="#2-Calibration" class="headerlink" title="2. Calibration"></a>2. Calibration</h4><p> Though most powerful monitors have what it takes to render colors accurately, how well they achieve this level of performance will depend on how well and how often they’re calibrated. The same is true for the SW320 which supports external hardware calibration. BenQ has a proprietary color calibration software known as Palette Master Element. This software works well with a number of external calibration devices such as X-Rite, Spyder and Display Pro. Using the software and hardware together, the SW320 can be set to perform at optimal color fidelity and depth.</p><p> Before calibrating any BenQ SW320 straight out of the box, it’s a good idea to go over the individual performance report that ships with it. Each report is unique. It provides a reliable baseline for understanding and assessing an SW320’s performance over time. Beyond its utility, these reports are also a good indication of BenQ’s commitment to quality and excellence.</p><h4 id="3-Ease-of-Use"><a href="#3-Ease-of-Use" class="headerlink" title="3. Ease of Use"></a>3. Ease of Use</h4><p> One could argue that the effectiveness of a device’s assembly manual is a good measure of how well it is designed. In this regard, the BenQ SW320 scores another homerun. Its illustrated assembly manual is easy to follow. This allows for a stress-free set up experience that’s bound to be reassuring to anyone who’s spent $1500 on a monitor.</p><p> In the assembly manual, each part is labelled and arrows are used effectively to show how parts fit together. This clear sequencing means that most users can assemble their SW320s themselves. Granted its assembly manual makes setting up easy, there’s no shame in asking for help and doing some research. The SW320’s Monitor Shading Hood in particular, may prove a bit more difficult to assemble than the rest of the unit.</p><h4 id="4-Highlighted-Features"><a href="#4-Highlighted-Features" class="headerlink" title="4. Highlighted Features"></a>4. Highlighted Features</h4><p> Getting to know the strengths of the BenQ SW320 monitor is much like peeling back the layers of an onion. Many of its coolest features are nested within others and may not be apparent unless discussed. One such strength is the fact that due to its IPS LCD panel, the SW320 can display colors consistently at up to 178 degrees. This means that color depth and accuracy remain unchanged when this monitor is viewed from wide horizontally and vertically angles. This is certainly great for multi-viewer situations and in a way, compensates for the somewhat limited swivel angle of the SW320.</p><p> The Delta-E(ΔE) figures for this monitor are also very impressive and provide a sense of the high-level color fidelity it delivers consistently. Delta-E represents the difference between the color requested and the actual color rendered by the monitor. In general, figures under 2.0 are considered very good. According to some testers, the SW320 consistently scores a Delta-E that’s less than 1.2. This means that in many color modes, this monitor renders colors that are very true to what’s expected.</p><p> One last feature worth highlighting is the HotKey Puck’s custom option. It takes quick Display Menu access to a whole new level. While it is set by default to lead to standard menu options like Display, Color Adjustment and PIP&#x2F;PBP, the buttons on the Puck can actually be set to any functionality depending on what a user prefers. This includes custom color calibrations and any other custom settings a user may need in her workflow.</p><h4 id="5-Responsiveness"><a href="#5-Responsiveness" class="headerlink" title="5.Responsiveness"></a>5.Responsiveness</h4><p> As far as responsiveness goes, the SW320 is an okay performer. Its IPN LCD panel has a best response rate of 5ms. While this is great for rendering HD pictures and HD Video editing, it makes this monitor unsuited for quick-action gaming. Gaming monitors tend to have TN LCD panels precisely because they afford an excellent 1ms response rate that ensures screen-tearing and stuttering are minimized.</p><p> With its 5ms response rate, the SW320 may experience noticeable image rendering failures if used for fast-action gaming. For the most part however, this monitor performs exceedingly well for professional image processing and alright for minimal gaming use. It is worth emphasizing that the BenQ SW320 monitor is specifically designed to be used by visual design professionals. In light of this, its 5ms response rate is more than sufficient.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p> We can all agree that the BenQ SW320 has an impressive roll of positives. Assessed by any standard, it performs superbly and delivers many pleasant surprises to boot.</p><p> With this monitor, users need not worry about being hampered by outdated hardware any time soon. The BenQ SW320 comes with the latest in display and input port technologies. Far from being left behind, the BenQ may up the demand for PCs that have powerful GPUs and the latest output ports.</p><p> For professional photographers, videographers and Graphic Designers, the SW320 is a dream. At an affordable price bracket of $1450 - $1500, this monitor puts state-of-the-art color processing features within reach. And with proprietary features like GamutDuo and Palette Master Element, Visual Professionals can optimize their workflow significantly.</p><p><img                       lazyload

As we all know, many podcasters are doing all it takes to get their podcast to the right audience, but the truth is you don’t just publish a podcast any day. Although this might sound weird to newbies, professionals should know this.</p><p>You need to have a specific day(s) with time to release your podcast and stick to it. Doing so will allow you to build trust and loyalty amongst listeners.</p><p>With that said, knowing the best day to release a podcast is crucial for any podcaster, and in this article, we’ll enlighten you on all you need to know about that. So, just stick with us to find out more.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-Does-Podcast-Publishing-Schedule-Matter"><a href="#Part-1-Does-Podcast-Publishing-Schedule-Matter" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Does Podcast Publishing Schedule Matter?"></a>Part 1: Does Podcast Publishing Schedule Matter?</h2><p>Having a podcast publishing schedule might sound negligible, but it is very essential for every podcaster, especially newbies. Listeners will stick to your podcast if they find it interesting, but to make them loyal, you need to build trust by publishing podcasts regularly on specific days and times every week. In addition, doing this will make your podcast more relevant in the space.</p><p>Also, keep in mind that choosing a suitable publishing schedule for your podcast depends on the niche you focus on and your target audience.

(The Megaphone Report)"></a>Part 2: What Is the Best Day To Release a Podcast? (The Megaphone Report)</h2><p>Truth be told, no specific day is considered the best to release a podcast. However, Megaphone’s report on the daily podcast publishes report shows that podcasters tend to publish their podcast more on weekdays (Monday - Friday) between 2 AM, 5 AM, and 11 PM. The chart below explains the stat report better.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/best-day-to-release-a-podcast-1.jpg"                      alt="best-day-to-release-a-podcast"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1424529">                    <video width="864" height="1536" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1424529.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1424529">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1424529.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Flaganoo.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1424529%2F16446'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1424529/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>As you can see from the chart above, the best day to publish a podcast is on weekdays. But check the following chart to see the median number of total downloads for every podcast episode posted per hour during the weekdays.</p><p>The chart on the left is the number of episodes published per hour from Monday to Friday, while the chart on the left displays the median total downloads of episodes the podcast episodes get over time.</p><p>Overall, it shows that podcast episodes published in the early hours of a new day tend to do better until 5 AM when their performance starts to drop. However, episodes published just before noon does best in the afternoon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/best-day-to-release-a-podcast-2.jpg"                      alt="best-day-to-release-a-podcast"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/1013424/11832" target="_top" id="1013424">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-1013424" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/1013424/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Takeaways-for-the-best-day-to-release-a-podcast"><a href="#Takeaways-for-the-best-day-to-release-a-podcast" class="headerlink" title="Takeaways for the best day to release a podcast"></a>Takeaways for the best day to release a podcast</h3><p>Here is our take on the podcast publish statistics analyzed by Megaphone in the charts above.</p><p><strong>1. Weekdays are much more popular than weekends</strong></p><p>From the podcast publish days’ statistics in the chart above, it’s obvious most podcasters publish on weekdays compared to weekends. Yes, over 40,000 podcast episodes are published during weekdays while on weekends, it’s within 4,000 to 5,000 episodes. The publishing time usually falls between 2 AM to 5 AM.</p><p>However, in our opinion, we don’t recommend publishing a new podcast at midnight, instead do it by 5 AM. This is will prevent the risk of your podcast getting buried under other podcasters’ shows on the app you are using, and enhance the chances of your podcast being on the first page, thus making it easily seen by your audience.</p><p><strong>2. When is the most popular publishing day?</strong></p><p>Based on the chart above, Wednesday is when the most podcast episodes are published. Over 9000 podcast episodes are published on this day, and the hour with the highest number of publishing is 2 AM.</p><p>But does this mean you should publish your podcast at exactly 2 AM on Wednesday? No! Instead, consider when your audience is most likely to listen. Will they prefer to tune in on their way to work, during work, on their way home, while doing house chores at home, or at night? You need to have a breakdown of this data, so you can choose the best time to publish your podcast.</p><p><strong>3. When is the worst?</strong></p><p>The worst day to publish a podcast is on Sunday, and as mentioned earlier, if you’re publishing during weekdays, do not publish at midnight. But note that the niche of your podcast matters. If Saturday and Sunday are when your audience tends to listen to your podcasts, then don’t hesitate to publish new episodes on weekends.</p><p>The hour with the most downloads per average episode is 5 AM Tuesday, followed by 5 AM Friday and 5 AM Thursday. Still, as mentioned earlier the time when your audience is most like to listen to the podcast matters.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettifr.pxf.io/c/5597632/2145082/17095" target="_top" id="2145082">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17095-2145082" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettifr.pxf.io/i/5597632/2145082/17095"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-Warning-Downfall-Don’t-Post-at-the-Time-Others-Do"><a href="#Part-3-Warning-Downfall-Don’t-Post-at-the-Time-Others-Do" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Warning Downfall: Don’t Post at the Time Others Do"></a>Part 3: Warning Downfall: Don’t Post at the Time Others Do</h2><p>The charts above were published by Megaphone based on the podcast episodes published on their platform. However, if you intend to choose the days to publish a podcast based on that, then it’s sad to say you’re about to make a big mistake.</p><p>The truth is it takes time and consistency to find the best days to publish podcasts. Even successful podcasters you see today never had the best days have the best days to publish content when they started. So, before you rush to start posting your podcast based on the chart or how other podcasters upload content, here are things you should know;</p><h3 id="1-Different-podcast-platforms-have-different-algorithms"><a href="#1-Different-podcast-platforms-have-different-algorithms" class="headerlink" title="1. Different podcast platforms have different algorithms"></a>1. Different podcast platforms have different algorithms</h3><p>If you conduct an analysis of how podcast platforms work, you’ll discover all podcast platforms don’t have the same algorithm. For example, the way the Apple Podcast app works can be the same as that of Spotify, Player FM, Stitcher, and many others.</p><p>During our review of different podcast apps, we discovered Apple Podcast app algorithm tends to favor newer episodes, except if you have a show you haven’t listened to in a while. There are also podcast apps with a similar algorithm, but the best time and day to publish podcasts varies.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983471">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983471.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983471">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983471.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983471%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983471/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-What-works-for-other-podcasters-might-not-work-for-You"><a href="#2-What-works-for-other-podcasters-might-not-work-for-You" class="headerlink" title="2. What works for other podcasters might not work for You"></a>2. What works for other podcasters might not work for You</h3><p>Just as the saying goes, “One man’s food could be another man’s poison”. Many regular podcasters usually upload content today because other podcasters have done the same. But unfortunately, it’s not a good move to just do things because others are doing it in the podcasting space. So, it’s advisable not to post at the same time others do.</p><h3 id="Tips-Takeaways-to-find-the-best-day-for-your-podcast-show"><a href="#Tips-Takeaways-to-find-the-best-day-for-your-podcast-show" class="headerlink" title="Tips &amp; Takeaways to find the best day for your podcast show"></a>Tips &amp; Takeaways to find the best day for your podcast show</h3><p>We absolutely can’t help you choose the best day to release a podcast. However, the following tips could help you decide what day and time will suit your podcast show.</p><p><strong>a. Avoid times when your audience will hardly listen to your podcast</strong></p><p>Most people look for podcasts when they are looking for information conversationally. So, you must do findings on knowing when your audience will want to listen to your podcast, though research shows that more people listen to podcasts on Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday between 2 AM and 5 AM. But 5 AM is the best time to gather more downloads.</p><p><strong>b. Try to tie it to something more predictable</strong></p><p>Sometimes, you just need to think out of the box when choosing the best day for your podcast. For example, we know weekdays are for going to work, and more people tend to download podcasts by 5 AM on Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday.

This voice changer is optimized for online gaming or pranking your friends on video and voice chats on apps like Skype, Meet Now, Zoom, and more.</p><p>You only need to select it as your input microphone to use it. MorphVOX Junior will enable you to convert your voice into a man, woman, or Tiny Folks. You can also customize your voice with background sound effects like an alarm clock, screech, cuckoo, and more.</p><p>However, this voice changer is best suited for entertainment than serious-business voice changing. That’s because it’s pretty basic in terms of everything. For example, you only get three voices and four sound effects. Other than that, it’s an excellent free voice changer to have on your computer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/morphvox-voice-changer-1.jpg"                      alt="morphvox voice changer junior"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-What-is-MorphVOX-Pro-voice-changer"><a href="#Part-2-What-is-MorphVOX-Pro-voice-changer" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Unlike the Junior version, this voice changer is compatible with macOS and Windows systems. It’s super easy to set up and is compatible with a range of desktop apps, including CS:GO, Skype, Discord, and more.</p><p>But the Junior version doesn’t come close when it comes to voice-changing capabilities. MorphVOX Pro will change your voice into tens of active voices, including a man, woman, robot, demon, droid, child, and more. You can even download more voice effects directly on the software.</p><p>Meanwhile, you can beautify your voice further using the multi-band graphic equalizer. Also, this professional voice changer boasts effective noise reduction and voice comparison capabilities. Voice parsing detection and stereo microphone are also supported. And yes, you can record the morphed voice and morph local sound files. All in all, this voice changer is worth every penny.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/morphvox-voice-changer-2.jpg"                      alt="morphvox voice changer pro"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-use-MorphVOX-voice-changer"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-use-MorphVOX-voice-changer" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

Although it’s compatible with Linux, Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android, we’ll learn how to use it on Windows PC. Now follow me!</p><p>Step1 Assuming you already have a Discord account, head straight to Screamingbee.com and install MorphVOX Junior.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/morphvox-voice-changer-3.jpg"                      alt="download morphvox voice changer junior"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1934258/19272" target="_top" id="1934258">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1934258" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1934258/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Step2 Once the app is up and running, head to Discord and click the <strong>User Settings</strong> icon at the bottom of the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/morphvox-voice-changer-4.jpg"                      alt="morphvox voice changer junior open discord settings"                ></p><p>Step3 Then, tap <strong>Voice &amp; Video</strong> before choosing the <strong>Input Device</strong> as <strong>Screaming Bee Audio</strong>.

How to use MorphVOX voice changer on Mac?"></a>Part 4. How to use MorphVOX voice changer on Mac?</h2><p>As said earlier, MorphVOX Junior is only compatible with Windows PCs. So, in this section, we want to learn how to use <strong>MorphVOX on Mac</strong>. I guess that means purchasing the Pro version. However, you’ll enjoy unlimited voice-changing capabilities. So, wasting time, here are the steps:</p><p>Step1 Go to Screamingbee.com and install MorphVOX Pro for macOS. This program runs on Mac OS X 10.6 or newer. After installing, complete the purchase by requesting a product key.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/morphvox-voice-changer-6.jpg"                      alt="down morphvox voice changer pro"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115921/19272" target="_top" id="2115921">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115921" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115921/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Step2 Now go back to MorphVOX Pro and choose an active voice. You can speak like a woman, man, robot, hell demon, or dog translator. If the available voice options are insufficient, click <strong>Tools</strong> and tap <strong>Manage Voices Pack</strong>. Now you can download and install new voice packs conveniently from within the program. Just tap the <strong>Download</strong> button to download the voice pack.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/morphvox-voice-changer-7.jpg"                      alt="morphvox voice changer pro download voice pack"                ></p><p>Step3 Next, let’s set MorphVOX Pro to work on Skype. To do that, tap the <strong>Preferences</strong> menu on Skype and click the <strong>Audio&#x2F;Video</strong> tab. Then, change the microphone to <strong>MorphVOX Audio</strong>. Now make your Skype call using the new voice.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/morphvox-voice-changer-8.jpg"                      alt="morphvox voice changer pro choose skype microphone"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://coinrule.sjv.io/c/5597632/1958378/18409" target="_top" id="1958378">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18409-1958378" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://coinrule.sjv.io/i/5597632/1958378/18409"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1495277">                    <video width="1536" height="864" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1495277.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17189-1495277">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1495277.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:960px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Ffunwhole.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1495277%2F17189'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1495277/17189"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-5-FAQs-about-MorphVOX-voice-changer"><a href="#Part-5-FAQs-about-MorphVOX-voice-changer" class="headerlink" title="Part 5.

Aside from the limited options, one more thing that is worth noting about the current state of VR is the fact that content is limited, as well as the applications. Most of the products available on the market today are targeted towards gamers and mostly exclusive to high-end buyers because of its expensive price.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134236/18498" target="_top" id="2134236">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134236" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134236/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="The-most-popular-brands-of-VR-headsets-today-is-Oculus-Rift"><a href="#The-most-popular-brands-of-VR-headsets-today-is-Oculus-Rift" class="headerlink" title="The most popular brands of VR headsets today is Oculus Rift"></a>The most popular brands of VR headsets today is Oculus Rift</h3><p><strong>One of the most popular brands of VR headsets today is Oculus Rift, which is also what is used in Samsung Gear VR.</strong> It started from a Kick starter campaign and has now grown into what is the most popular within the product category.

Google Cardboard, meanwhile, is an option that is similar in terms of effects, but simpler in terms of technology. It uses a simple cardboard with integrated optics to create the VR effect.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137218/26400" target="_top" id="2137218">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137218" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137218/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2016-is-going-to-be-a-big-year-for-VR"><a href="#2016-is-going-to-be-a-big-year-for-VR" class="headerlink" title="2016 is going to be a big year for VR"></a>2016 is going to be a big year for VR</h3><p><strong>Deloitte, in one of its researches, have noted that 2016 is going to be a big year for VR,</strong> predicting that it will be a billion dollar industry, with $700 million resulting from hardware sales and the remaining amount from content. By 2020, it is expected that it will be worth more than $14.6 billion. More so, in a report by Goldman Sachs, it has been reiterated that there are more than $3.25 billion in venture capital investments in the VR industry, which is reflective of the high hopes of businesses that it is indeed going to be the next big thing in entertainment.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/resource/vr-technology.jpg"                      alt="vr-technology"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Challenges-for-VR"><a href="#Part-2-Challenges-for-VR" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Challenges for VR"></a>Part 2: Challenges for VR</h2><h3 id="Powerful-computers-and-smartphones-will-be-required"><a href="#Powerful-computers-and-smartphones-will-be-required" class="headerlink" title="Powerful computers and smartphones will be required"></a>Powerful computers and smartphones will be required</h3><p> In spite of being full of potential, however, there are also some challenges that should be addressed in order to ensure the success of VR. Among others, one of the most significant would be the need for powerful devices that would complement the headsets. <strong>Powerful computers and smartphones will be required to render the effects that are anticipated.</strong> For Oculus Rift, for instance, a powerful video card is needed for a computer, something you might not have at home, making the VR technology inapplicable.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1938141">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1938141.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1938141">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1938141.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1938141%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1938141/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="VR-design"><a href="#VR-design" class="headerlink" title="VR design"></a>VR design</h3><p> In addition, there are also challenges when it comes to aesthetics.

There are limited choices when it comes to VR products available on the market, and for many, it is still a bit expensive. Others lack knowledge on how it works, which results into hesitation. There are also some obstacles that have yet to be addressed and more opportunities to be uncovered. It would be safe to say that it is still in its infancy, but slowly, it is getting to the top.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Benjamin Arango</p><p>Benjamin Arango is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Benjamin Arango</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-quantum-hdr-everything-you-may-want-to-know-about-quantum-hdr/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Quantum HDR Everything You May Want to Know About Quantum HDR</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-step-by-step-to-mastering-adobes-cloud-storage-capabilities-and-options/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Step-by-Step to Mastering Adobe's Cloud Storage Capabilities & Options</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-unveiling-5-compelling-literary-video-tts/"><u>[New] In 2024, Unveiling 5 Compelling Literary Video TTs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-perfect-pan-and-tilt-for-clearer-captures/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Perfect Pan & Tilt for Clearer Captures</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-commercial-cloud-repository-standouts/"><u>[Updated] Commercial Cloud Repository Standouts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-leveraging-viewership-the-mechanics-of-product-sponsored-youtube-videos/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Leveraging Viewership The Mechanics of Product-Sponsored YouTube Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/updated-proven-strategies-building-time-lapses-using-samsung-cameras/"><u>[Updated] Proven Strategies Building Time-Lapses Using Samsung Cameras</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-access.techidaily.com/updated-swap-periscope-leading-video-apps-for-iphoneandroid-devices/"><u>[Updated] Swap Periscope Leading Video Apps for iPhone/Android Devices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/1725285449017-dvd/"><u>「新作ディズニーDVDの検出不可能なコピー手順」</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/2024-approved-breaking-down-the-animation-process-a-movie-maker-approach/"><u>2024 Approved Breaking Down the Animation Process A Movie Maker Approach</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/a-beginners-insight-into-av1-encoding/"><u>A Beginner's Insight Into AV1 Encoding</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-apple-iphone-12-mini-unavailable-issue-with-ease-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>How To Fix Apple iPhone 12 mini Unavailable Issue With Ease | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-can-i-unlock-my-apple-iphone-12-mini-after-forgetting-my-pin-code-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, How Can I Unlock My Apple iPhone 12 mini After Forgetting my PIN Code? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/pilots-perspective-dji-dualsense-fpv-tech/"><u>Pilot's Perspective DJI DualSense FPV Tech</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/pro-chromebook-zoom-usage-techniques/"><u>Pro Chromebook Zoom Usage Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/swift-action-for-stabilizing-plugin-service-communication/"><u>Swift Action for Stabilizing Plugin-Service Communication</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-tools.techidaily.com/updated-top-10-free-video-repeater-tools-for-seamless-loops-for-2024/"><u>Updated Top 10 Free Video Repeater Tools for Seamless Loops for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

But we always can’t capture that “very moment” due to our DLSR unavailability. But don’t give up. One fact that may be hidden from you is the “iPhone HDR mode”. What you don’t know is that, you can take excellent HDR photo on iPhone. HDR iPhone is your hidden starlet.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part1: What does HDR photo mean</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part2: How to use HDR photo on iPhone</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part3: How to discard normal photo</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part4: When to use iPhone HDR mode</a></li><li><a href="#part5">Part5: When not to take HDR photo on iPhone</a></li></ul><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part1-What-does-HDR-photo-mean"><a href="#Part1-What-does-HDR-photo-mean" class="headerlink" title="Part1: What does HDR photo mean"></a>Part1: What does HDR photo mean</h2><p> For a novice like me, this seems like a million dollar question. HDR stands for “High Dynamic Range”. It explains the difference between the vision of a human eye and a camera. A human eye can miraculously differentiate between intensities of light and colour. Hence we can see perfect brightness, shadows, colours and contrasts. A camera cannot do that naturally. Like capturing sunset through lightened towers or darker object in bright surrounding can result in too bright or too dark photo.</p><p> The hidden star in such cases is the HDR effect. It merges “the lights” and “the darks” to give a better picture. It’s all about blending the photos with different exposures. iPhone HDR mode, will behind the scene, take 3 different exposures of the same image. Under-exposed (darkest), over-exposed (striking light) and normal. It will then blend all three to combine best parts. The resulting HDR photo will have best details, sharpness, colors and light.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/HDR-comparison.jpg"                      alt="HDR"                ></p><h2 id="Part2-How-to-use-HDR-photo-on-iPhone"><a href="#Part2-How-to-use-HDR-photo-on-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part2: How to use HDR photo on iPhone"></a>Part2: How to use HDR photo on iPhone</h2><p> If you are using the latest devices (iPhone 8&#x2F;Plus and X), then there is good news for you.

But if you are worried about memory consumption then slide the toggle “keep normal photo” to off.</p><p> Now, as you know how to use it, you might get tempted to use it every time. No! Just like too much of sweet is bad for teeth, too much of HDR can also spoil the result. You should know when to use and when not to use it.

So instead of hemming and hawing over the blown-out sky for land details or perfectly coloured sky for blackened land, use HDR. It’s best to capture the “brightest white” to the “darkest black”.

Suppose you want to capture shadow then HDR will make the difference less intense. If you want to capture the striking colour or light difference, HDR will normalise and blend it to make less interesting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/High-contrast-scenes.jpg"                      alt="high contrast"                ></p><h4 id="Vivid-colourful-scenes"><a href="#Vivid-colourful-scenes" class="headerlink" title="Vivid colourful scenes"></a>Vivid colourful scenes</h4><p> Sometimes the scene has rich colours. The crisp and vibrant colours need to be captured. As HDR does bring the detail forward from too dark or too bright but, at the same time, it can wash out the sharpness</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Vivid-colourful-scenes.jpg"                      alt="Vivid"                ></p><h4 id="Scenes-with-movements"><a href="#Scenes-with-movements" class="headerlink" title="Scenes with movements"></a>Scenes with movements</h4><p> If you are moving or any subject in the scene to be captured is moving. Even if, there is a possibility that something in the scene might move then don’t use HDR.(Don’t in capital letters). As HDR is all about taking three shots so any movement between them will result in ghosting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Scenes-with-movements.jpg"                      alt="movements"                ></p><h4 id="Quick-Snap"><a href="#Quick-Snap" class="headerlink" title="Quick Snap"></a>Quick Snap</h4><p> If you want to take a quick snap then HDR will be too slow for you. As it takes a little longer, owing to the fact that it takes 3 pictures and combines them for the final outcome.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Quick-Snap.jpg"                      alt="Snap"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2036496/19272" target="_top" id="2036496">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2036496" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2036496/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p> iPhone HDR mode is just perfect to capture high contrast scenes, landscapes with very light and very dark areas, shaded subjects or when the light source is just at the back of subject. But again if this doesn’t satisfy you, use third party HDR software. There are some good ones for more dramatic and processed results. So don’t stop your innate instinct. Grab your HDR iPhone or iPad running iO7 or later and click.</p><p> Images come from the Internet</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Ollie Mattison</p><p>Ollie Mattison is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Ollie Mattison</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-mastering-your-digital-talk-leading-web-based-text-to-speech-apps-for-chrome/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Mastering Your Digital Talk Leading Web-Based Text-to-Speech Apps for Chrome</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/est-5-youtube-video-editor-alternatives/"><u>[New] Best 5 YouTube Video Editor Alternatives</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/hannel-specific-choices-top-microphone-picks-adapted-to-each-youtube-niche/"><u>[New] Channel-Specific Choices Top Microphone Picks Adapted To Each YouTube Niche</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-sharp-lenses-clear-visions-tips-for-fog-free-filming/"><u>[New] In 2024, Sharp Lenses, Clear Visions Tips for Fog-Free Filming</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-voice-virtuosity-in-free-fire-battles/"><u>[New] In 2024, Voice Virtuosity in Free Fire Battles</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-top-6-video-downloaders-preserve-your-linkedin-media-masterfully-for-2024/"><u>[New] Top 6 Video Downloaders Preserve Your LinkedIn Media Masterfully for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-photography-tutorial-how-to-shoot-and-create-impressive-hdr-portraits/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Photography Tutorial_ How to Shoot and Create Impressive HDR Portraits</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-social-media-savvy-turning-friends-into-customers-and-coins/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Social Media Savvy Turning Friends Into Customers and Coins</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-step-by-step-approach-to-mastering-the-steam-pro-controller-on-switch/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Step-by-Step Approach to Mastering the Steam Pro Controller on Switch</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-top-techniques-for-stunning-android-time-lapse-captures/"><u>[Updated] Top Techniques for Stunning Android Time-Lapse Captures</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-top-tier-srt-transformations-for-mac-and-windows-pcs/"><u>[Updated] Top-Tier SRT Transformations for Mac & Windows PCs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://program-issues.techidaily.com/effective-tips-for-smooth-csgo-performance-optimization/"><u>Effective Tips for Smooth CS:GO Performance Optimization</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/elevate-iphone-visuals-select-camera-extensions-for-quality-for-2024/"><u>Elevate iPhone Visuals Select Camera Extensions for Quality for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/expert-strategies-for-swift-and-smooth-media-navigation-for-2024/"><u>Expert Strategies for Swift and Smooth Media Navigation for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-unlock-your-vivo-v30s-potential-the-top-20-lock-screen-apps-you-need-to-try-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Unlock Your Vivo V30s Potential The Top 20 Lock Screen Apps You Need to Try</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/masterful-collage-techniques-for-instagram-excellence-for-2024/"><u>Masterful Collage Techniques for Instagram Excellence for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/yuneec-typhoon-q500-4k-review/"><u>Yuneec Typhoon Q500 4K Review</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

In case if you love <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >diving <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> then you must go for a waterproof device or one that can be protected with external housing. Those who are cycling enthusiasts may need to record everything on a go so it is good to pick a device that can be easily mounted on chest or <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >helmet <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It must also offer stabilized video recording. Similarly, athletes can have so many requirements but the good news is that the latest cameras are also developed with all stunning features to provide satisfactory results.</p><p> The guide below will help you to get best details about device as well as accessories so that you can have perfect camera for your adventure sports activities.</p><h2 id="Complete-Buying-Guide"><a href="#Complete-Buying-Guide" class="headerlink" title="Complete Buying Guide"></a>Complete Buying Guide</h2><h4 id="1-Mounts-–-Depends-on-You"><a href="#1-Mounts-–-Depends-on-You" class="headerlink" title="1.

Action cameras are usually lighter in weight, smaller in size and have waterproof design but note that not all companies use to manufacture cameras with these specifications. For example the GoPro camera shapes are completely different from that of Sony cameras. It is not possible to use same mount for both these devices to adjust them on suction cup or on helmet.</p><p> You can easily find so many third party accessories for action cameras that are available at different price ranges in market but the quality also varies. Even a camera mount with same design and shape can vary by great amount in terms of its material quality and price range. If you are buying a costly action camera then we suggest you to go for branded accessories only as they add safety to usage. Do not spend on cheaper models rather search for a company that you trust and know well.</p><p><strong>1. Head and Hat Mounts:</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/head-and-hat-mounts.jpg"                                     ></p><p> With few high quality cameras you will get head and hat mounts as additional accessories at the time of purchase but for few basic designs you may have to buy them separately. The general price range for mounts is above $10 and it varies as per your brand selection.</p><p><strong>2. Helmet Mounts:</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/helmet-mouts.jpg"                      alt="helmet mouts"                ></p><p> This is one of the most commonly available types of mounts and is more popular among action camera lovers. These mounts can assist users to mount camera from side, front, top or back of helmet. Such mounts are also developed for making easy connections with vented helmets and smooth surfaced, with this facility you can easily run the straps through different vents. The price range of helmet mounts usually starts at $10 but it increases with increase in complexity.</p><p><strong>3. Chest Mounts:</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/chest-mounts.jpg"                      alt="chest mounts"                ></p><p> Generally people wish to avoid the shakes that helmet and head mounts usually offer so they go for Chest mounts. These mounts provide much better POV look and are specially recommended for skiing. Most of the top manufacturers like Sony, Contour and GoPro use to offer action camera mount at initial price range of $15.</p><p><strong>4. Wrist Mounts:</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/wrist-mounts.jpg"                      alt="wrist mounts"                ></p><p> Wrist mounts are often preferred by divers but these days other users are also buying them. The price range for Wrist mounts starts from $15 and go much high with increasing quality.</p><p><strong>5. Motorcycle and Bicycle Mounts:</strong></p><p> Such type of mounts can be easily screwed with bike handles to have shaken proof recording. These mounts start from a price range of $10 but while using these mounts you need to keep in mind the road quality so that shakes can be avoided otherwise it may affect your footage.</p><h4 id="2-Power-Accessories-–-Buy-It"><a href="#2-Power-Accessories-–-Buy-It" class="headerlink" title="2. Power Accessories – Buy It"></a>2. Power Accessories – Buy It</h4><p> When you buy a branded action camera then it comes with a standard <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >battery unit <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, few device uses to have removable battery whereas other have fixed battery unit inside. For users, it is necessary to have information about how long life their battery will have with 4K shooting or with 1080p level. If you are planning to film for the whole day then you may need additional batteries for replacement if possible.</p><p> Many third party sellers will offer you camera compatible <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >batteries <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> at cheap price range but lots of risks are involved in that. Few of these can serve you perfectly for long hours but others may start heating up the whole device with time. Prefer to check user reviews before investing on such batteries.</p><h4 id="3-Fast-Memory-Card-–-Depends-on-You"><a href="#3-Fast-Memory-Card-–-Depends-on-You" class="headerlink" title="3.

If you have better stock then you will never face trouble if a card fails at the time of shooting. It is even good to carry a mixture of big and small cards but ensure that you have bought them from trustworthy companies and they will never harm your camera. Note that there are so many big and small companies in market that are selling memory cards in bulk but the quality may vary by great extent.</p><h4 id="4-Waterproof-Housing-–-Buy-It"><a href="#4-Waterproof-Housing-–-Buy-It" class="headerlink" title="4. Waterproof Housing – Buy It"></a>4. Waterproof Housing – Buy It</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/waterproof-housing.jpg"                                     ></p><p> It is not necessary that your water resistant camera is waterproof too because few designs are not having such feature. If you need a waterproof camera then you may need additional waterproof housing for it. While buying such cameras you need to know that how deep it can go under water as few cameras are rated with underwater safety up to 60’ or others may have up to 30’. These waterproof designs also serve with great sand protection; whereas impact resistance is one more important element that you need to consider for protected camera design.</p><h4 id="5-Lights-–-Depends-on-You"><a href="#5-Lights-–-Depends-on-You" class="headerlink" title="5. Lights – Depends on You"></a>5. Lights – Depends on You</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/action-camera-lights.jpg"                                     ></p><p> The action cam lights usually come with so many function and size variations. Most of these are camera specific whereas others possess special conversion type adapters that can be easily attached to other devices. While buying such lights you must get enough details about their usage, power and battery life. <strong>Intova</strong> manufacturers use to provide classic dive lights with a price tag of $40 and it can be used with one handed operation.</p><p><strong>Qudos</strong> have developed lights for GoPro action camera and its price is around $120 whereas overall weight uses to be less than 150 grams. This accessory use to be waterproof up to the depth of 40 meters under water so it is rated to be ideal for scuba divers. The best news for buyers is that Qudos action cam light is compatible with most of non GoPro cameras if you have a simple conversion mount. So if you are a first time buyer then it will be a great offer for you.</p><h4 id="6-Audio-–-Depends-on-You"><a href="#6-Audio-–-Depends-on-You" class="headerlink" title="6.

Such devices can easily sync even with low quality audio inputs or external mics so that you can have perfect recording on the go. It also supports classic recording with stereo microphones that are designed with omni-directional style. Few cameras provide perfect support to audio signals even with external housing and the footage is always with crystal clear voice. Such designs are really suitable if you wish to choose the live streaming option as you will be able to upload stunning videos without pre-processing.</p><p><strong>You May Also Like</strong>: <a class="link"   href="https://filmora.wondershare.com/action-camera/best-mics-for-action-cameras.html" >Best Microphones for Action Cameras 2017 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="7-Filters-–-Depends-on-You"><a href="#7-Filters-–-Depends-on-You" class="headerlink" title="7.

When you are recording a shoot under water up to depth of 3 meters or 9 feet then it is sufficient to have better white balance. On the other side if you have to go below 9 feet then complete colour filters become essential. When you use filters then it is possible to have much better variations over foreground and background colours. These filters assist in improved colour distribution for recorded footage and produce a richer blue at background. This is definitely an important aesthetic when you are shooting under water.</p><h4 id="8-Remote-Controls-–-Unnecessary"><a href="#8-Remote-Controls-–-Unnecessary" class="headerlink" title="8.

Before you apply <strong>Goofy movie VHS effects</strong> to your video, learn how they were used. Here are some ways this technology was used in old movies:</p><p><strong>1. Home Video Market</strong></p><p>VHS has revolutionized the home video market by introducing the concept of renting movies. People used to either rent or own movies on videocassettes. It allowed them to watch movies conveniently without relying on theatrical screenings. Movie studios and distributors started releasing films on VHS tapes, which could be rented from stores.</p><p><strong>2. Preservation and Archiving</strong></p><p>This technology also facilitated the preservation and archiving of movies. Film studios, libraries, and institutions started transferring movies from reels to VHS tapes. It allowed for easier storage, duplication, and accessibility of movies. Additionally, it is a more manageable way to store the archives and a widely compatible format.</p><p><strong>3. Film Distribution</strong></p><p>These tapes became a popular format for distributing movies to rental stores and retail outlets. Film distributors would duplicate and distribute movies on VHS tapes. Then, these VHS tapes are sold or rented to customers. This widespread distribution contributed to the availability of movies for home viewing.</p><p><strong>4. Independent Filmmaking</strong></p><p>It provided independent filmmakers with an affordable and accessible medium for movie distribution. Filmmakers could shoot their movies on video cameras and duplicate them onto these tapes. It further allows them to self-distribute or sell their films directly to audiences. Furthermore, these tapes can reach a wider audience and establish the careers of many filmmakers.</p><p><strong>5. Special Editions and Bonus Features</strong></p><p>As the VHS market grew, movie distributors released special editions and collector’s versions. These releases often included bonus features like behind-the-scenes footage and more. It also included interviews, the making of the movie, and deleted scenes. Similarly, people can experience additional content beyond the theatrical release.</p><p><strong>6. Film Education and Study</strong></p><p>Such tapes became a valuable resource for film education and study. Film schools, universities, and film enthusiasts would compile these tapes for research purposes. It allows students and researchers to study and analyze films at their own pace. Similarly, it provided a medium for referencing and studying specific scenes or films in detail.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Wondershare-Filmora-The-New-Age-VHS-Technology-Video-Editor"><a href="#Part-3-Wondershare-Filmora-The-New-Age-VHS-Technology-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Wondershare Filmora: The New Age VHS Technology Video Editor"></a>Part 3: Wondershare Filmora: The New Age VHS Technology Video Editor</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, like always, is a solution to your editing problems.

Before you apply <strong>Goofy movie VHS effects</strong> to your video, learn how they were used. Here are some ways this technology was used in old movies:</p><p><strong>1. Home Video Market</strong></p><p>VHS has revolutionized the home video market by introducing the concept of renting movies. People used to either rent or own movies on videocassettes. It allowed them to watch movies conveniently without relying on theatrical screenings. Movie studios and distributors started releasing films on VHS tapes, which could be rented from stores.</p><p><strong>2. Preservation and Archiving</strong></p><p>This technology also facilitated the preservation and archiving of movies. Film studios, libraries, and institutions started transferring movies from reels to VHS tapes. It allowed for easier storage, duplication, and accessibility of movies. Additionally, it is a more manageable way to store the archives and a widely compatible format.</p><p><strong>3. Film Distribution</strong></p><p>These tapes became a popular format for distributing movies to rental stores and retail outlets. Film distributors would duplicate and distribute movies on VHS tapes. Then, these VHS tapes are sold or rented to customers. This widespread distribution contributed to the availability of movies for home viewing.</p><p><strong>4. Independent Filmmaking</strong></p><p>It provided independent filmmakers with an affordable and accessible medium for movie distribution. Filmmakers could shoot their movies on video cameras and duplicate them onto these tapes. It further allows them to self-distribute or sell their films directly to audiences. Furthermore, these tapes can reach a wider audience and establish the careers of many filmmakers.</p><p><strong>5. Special Editions and Bonus Features</strong></p><p>As the VHS market grew, movie distributors released special editions and collector’s versions. These releases often included bonus features like behind-the-scenes footage and more. It also included interviews, the making of the movie, and deleted scenes. Similarly, people can experience additional content beyond the theatrical release.</p><p><strong>6. Film Education and Study</strong></p><p>Such tapes became a valuable resource for film education and study. Film schools, universities, and film enthusiasts would compile these tapes for research purposes. It allows students and researchers to study and analyze films at their own pace. Similarly, it provided a medium for referencing and studying specific scenes or films in detail.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Wondershare-Filmora-The-New-Age-VHS-Technology-Video-Editor-1"><a href="#Part-3-Wondershare-Filmora-The-New-Age-VHS-Technology-Video-Editor-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Wondershare Filmora: The New Age VHS Technology Video Editor"></a>Part 3: Wondershare Filmora: The New Age VHS Technology Video Editor</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, like always, is a solution to your editing problems.

The device offers a range of exciting features, including its generous battery life, outstanding appearance, enhanced telephoto camera, exceptionally smooth screen and innovative Face ID feature. Coming complete with a host of new and improved camera features, the iPhone X has helped Apple retain its reputation as one of the most pioneering and popular brands of all time. Let’s take a look at some of the0 <strong>best camera features</strong> the iPhone X has to offer right now.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: TrueDepth Camera</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: The importance of depth</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: How to use portrait mode</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: Video improvement</a></li></ul><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-TrueDepth-Camera"><a href="#Part-1-TrueDepth-Camera" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: TrueDepth Camera"></a>Part 1: TrueDepth Camera</h2><p> The phone has a brand new rear <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >camera with two lenses <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in a vertical orientation. This new orientation has been chosen to provide more space for the front-facing TrueDepth camera. This camera is tasked with powering the Face ID feature. The TrueDepth system also has a f&#x2F;2.2 7-megapixel camera for selfies. The feature means Portrait Mode and Portrait Lighting are supported in front-facing mode. With Portrait Lighting, you can dynamically adjust your photo’s lighting with ease. TrueDepth uses an infrared emitter to project more than 30,000 in a recognised pattern onto users’ faces, before photographing the dots for analysis. The function is strengthened with a proximity sensor as well as an ambient light sensor which allows output light levels to be set.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118323/7443" target="_top" id="2118323">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118323" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118323/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-The-importance-of-depth"><a href="#Part-2-The-importance-of-depth" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: The importance of depth"></a>Part 2: The importance of depth</h2><p> With previous versions of the iPhone Plus, the depth maps were only used to blur backgrounds and make subjects pop against them. However, the iPhone X takes the depth information from the two lenses as well as the efficiency of the A11 Bionic chip to offer outstanding new special effects.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/depth-iphone.jpg"                      alt="depth camera"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151855/7443" target="_top" id="2151855">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151855" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151855/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-use-portrait-mode"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-use-portrait-mode" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to use portrait mode"></a>Part 3: How to use portrait mode</h2><p> Portrait mode uses your iPhone X’s telephoto lens kit to create images with “bokeh”-esque backgrounds and foregrounds. Portrait Lighting also comes as part of the Portrait Mode with the iPhone X, utilising both machine learning and the depth map of Portrait mode to add exceptional lighting effects to your photos in real time. When you shoot in Portrait mode, the wide-angle measures the difference between what it and the telephoto can see to offer a multi-point depth map. The depth map itself creates artificial depth of field.</p><p> There are many iOS 11 Camera app features available that will help you make the most of Portrait mode, including flash, filters, HDR and timed photos. You can even create a live-type Portrait photo by recording the screen of your device whilst in the Camera app.</p><p> To take a photo of a person in Portrait mode, take the following steps.</p><ul><li>Open your Camera app</li><li>Swipe to the Portrait settings</li><li>Stand between two to eight feet of your subject, allowing the face and body detection feature to identify your subject.</li><li>Follow the app’s prompts, which can include “Flash may help”, “move farther away”, and “more light required” amongst others.</li><li>The banner at the bottom of your screen will turn yellow once you have met the instructions</li><li>Swipe or tap the cube icons above your shutter button to change the lighting effects if needed.</li><li>To take your photo, press the shutter button.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/PortraitLighting.jpg"                      alt="portrait lighting"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Video-improvement"><a href="#Part-4-Video-improvement" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Video improvement"></a>Part 4: Video improvement</h2><p> The iPhone X is also noted for its first-class video shooting capabilities, including its 4K video feature. Though previous iterations of the iPhone were already rather adept at shooting in 4K, the new devices are even more impressive and have been favourably compared to the GH5 in terms of quality and clarity. The new device has been complimented for its vibrant colour profile and its ability to deliver 4K video that matches a wide range of leading DSLR and mirrorless cameras. It’s possible to capture video in 240fps slo-mo at 1080p and 4K at 60fps.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-improvement.JPG"                      alt="video improvement"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135406/19272" target="_top" id="2135406">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135406" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135406/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>You may also like:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Best iPhone Stabilizers for Video Shooting &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1948937/19272" target="_top" id="1948937">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1948937" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1948937/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p> There are many great reasons for investing in the iPhone X if you are interested in carrying a high-end camera around in your pocket. The phone is the smallest yet to feature two 12MP rear-facing cameras, with the updated telephoto lens also being a big draw for many. The lens has been optically stabilised and had its aperture boosted to f&#x2F;2.4 from f&#x2F;2.8. The phone is now able to offer vastly superior performance in low-light conditions, with the sensor having been completely rebuilt and a brand new image signal processor offering stunning colours and textures. In fact, the phone is able to perform convincingly in low-light conditions even when there are multiple light sources competing.</p><p> The phone has also been praised for its wide range between light and dark colours. The Face ID function has proved to be incredibly secure, unlike earlier facial recognition systems which could easily be tricked by with the use of photographs or videos. It’s now possible to be more creative than ever with your iPhone’s camera whilst benefiting from a wealth of robust security features.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Ollie Mattison</p><p>Ollie Mattison is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Ollie Mattison</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-10-must-know-tips-for-nba-stream-quality/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved 10 Must-Know Tips for NBA Stream Quality</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-professionals-guide-to-outstanding-4k-filmmaking-gear/"><u>[New] In 2024, Professionals' Guide to Outstanding 4K Filmmaking Gear</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/new-navigating-exit-the-guide-to-disconnecting-from-a-discord-community/"><u>[New] Navigating Exit The Guide to Disconnecting From a Discord Community</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-crafting-visual-narratives-effective-titling/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Crafting Visual Narratives Effective Titling</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-adding-media-to-enhance-content-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Adding Media to Enhance Content for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-essential-apps-for-effective-mac-sniping-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Essential Apps for Effective Mac Sniping for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/ed-how-to-make-youtube-video-the-ultimate-guide-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] How to Make YouTube Video The Ultimate Guide for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-dissecting-the-user-experience-in-vivavideo/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Dissecting the User Experience in VivaVideo</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-snorkel-ready-tech-the-finest-waterproof-camcorders-of-the-year/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Snorkel-Ready Tech The Finest Waterproof Camcorders of the Year</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-next-gen-storytelling-10-sci-fi-films-transporting-you-elsewhere-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Next Gen Storytelling 10 Sci-Fi Films Transporting You Elsewhere for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/2024-approved-secrets-to-the-ultimate-5-free-pinterest-video-loader/"><u>2024 Approved Secrets to the Ultimate 5-Free Pinterest Video Loader</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-video-recordings.techidaily.com/in-2024-enhance-your-videos-effective-titles-and-keywords-on-youtube/"><u>In 2024, Enhance Your Videos Effective Titles and Keywords on YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-fake-android-location-without-rooting-for-your-itel-s23-drfone-by-drfone-virtual/"><u>In 2024, Fake Android Location without Rooting For Your Itel S23 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/luminous-landscapes-designing-visuals-that-dazzle-viewers-for-2024/"><u>Luminous Landscapes Designing Visuals that Dazzle Viewers for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/preserve-your-legacy-transforming-older-images-into-modern-videos/"><u>Preserve Your Legacy Transforming Older Images Into Modern Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/ultimate-guide-to-fifa-19-dominating-the-genre-of-e-sports-games/"><u>Ultimate Guide to FIFA 19: Dominating the Genre of E-Sports Games</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Maybe you’re uploading videos to YouTube and your videos always seem too dark. Don’t get worried. There are some easy ways that you can make the video brighter and significantly improve its quality.</p><p>Videos are everywhere today. They are popping up on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.

This is an essential part of a game.</p><p> New way of detecting a person’s presence in a game is bio-sensing. These are small sensors which are attached to a data glove, suit or even the body and record movements made by that person in a 3D space. These movements are interpreted by a computer and trigger a variety of responses within that space. These movements are fed back to a computer which then analyses the data and uses it to transform your actions into the appropriate responses on the screen. It was 20 years ago that consumer-level virtual reality last looked likely to touch down, and if you got burned by Nintendo’s ill-fated Virtual Boy or dropped a bundle on theVFX1 Headgear, then you’re likely to be looking at the new crop of virtual reality entertainment technology with some skepticism.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ursime.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136545/16384" target="_top" id="2136545">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16384-2136545" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ursime.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136545/16384"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Virtual-Museums"><a href="#Virtual-Museums" class="headerlink" title="Virtual Museums"></a>Virtual Museums</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/virtual-museums.jpg"                      alt="virtual-museums"                ></p><p> Use of virtual reality in museum and historical settings e.g. visitor centers, interactive exhibitions. Interactive displays form a large part of many exhibitions and particularly appeal to children. Children are often difficult to attract at a museum or gallery, as they tend to see this as a boring experience. But the use of interactive technologies such as virtual reality entertainment has changed that perception and opened up these spaces to a new audience. This is a useful way of changing attitudes towards heritage sites such as museums and to encourage more people to visit and take part.</p><h3 id="Galleries"><a href="#Galleries" class="headerlink" title="Galleries"></a>Galleries</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/virtual-galleries.png"                      alt="virtual-galleries"                ></p><p> Immersive 3-D experience allows students to manipulate virtual objects and experience whatever they’re studying firsthand. Everything started with the pencil that was used to write the books. Then teachers started using the blackboard to improve the efficiency of class. Finally, we now have the abilities to answer any questions we have through the device that is in our pocket. The smartphones, tablets, laptops etc are used by universities to help students access their courses online at anytime.</p><h3 id="Theatre"><a href="#Theatre" class="headerlink" title="Theatre"></a>Theatre</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/virtual-theatre.jpg"                      alt="virtual-theatre"                ></p><p> Three recent productions are described which aimed to use virtual reality technologies not to stimulate reality but to achieve engagement of the audience. This is described as immersing the participant through engaging story telling. The three plays were The Adding Machine, Wings, and Tesla Electric, and they have provided a wealth of information on the art and practice of immersing a theater audience within a fictional world.</p><h3 id="Virtual-theme-parks"><a href="#Virtual-theme-parks" class="headerlink" title="Virtual theme parks"></a>Virtual theme parks</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/virtual-theme-parks.jpg"                      alt="virtual-theme-parks"                ></p><p> Get ready with goggles in theme parks. Virtual reality entertainment, with its computer generated sights and sounds that surround users, soon will transport park goers to places impossible to build. Virtual reality can create spaces that are too elaborate or fantastical to construct in real life and are scary and perilous. It also gives you characters that really are supernatural and paranormal, which sometimes we can’t physically do.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087484/7443" target="_top" id="2087484">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087484" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087484/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Music-VR-experience"><a href="#Music-VR-experience" class="headerlink" title="Music VR experience"></a>Music VR experience</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/music-vr-experience.jpg"                      alt="music-vr-experience"                ></p><p> Music is a game changer. If your sound isn’t at par, then the whole project can fall flat. Soon you will be able to strap on a headset and spend a day immersed in the life of almost anyone on earth. Just pop on a pair of virtual reality goggles and get ready to live a superstar’s life.</p><p> Virtual reality entertainment is the creation of a virtual environment presented to our senses in such a way that we experience it as if we were really there. It uses a host of technologies to achieve this goal and is a technically complex feat that has to account for our perception and cognition. We can expect to see many more innovative uses for the technology in the future and perhaps a fundamental way in which we communicate and work, thanks to the possibilities of virtual reality.</p><h2 id="Future-of-Virtual-Reality-entertainment"><a href="#Future-of-Virtual-Reality-entertainment" class="headerlink" title="Future of Virtual Reality entertainment"></a>Future of Virtual Reality entertainment</h2><p> It allows the person to view three-dimensional images and these images appear life-sized to the person. The aim is for a seamless connection between the person’s head and eye movements and the appropriate response (change in perception).
